Buffett\n","I read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nine-\n","teen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing\n","ever written. I still think it is.\n","To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato-\n","spheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.\n","What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci-\n","sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame-\n","work. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper\n","framework. You must supply the emotional discipline.\n","If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra-\n","ham advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable\n","advice in Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from\n","your investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment\n","than you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results\n","will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest-\n","ments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-\n","vail during your investing career. The sillier the market’s behavior,\n","the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow\n","Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.\n","To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher.\n","More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.\n","Shortly after Ben’s death in 1976, I wrote the following short\n","remembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal. As you\n","read the book, I believe you’ll perceive some of the qualities I men-\n","tioned in this tribute.\n","viii\n","ix\n","Preface to the Fourth Edition\n","BENJAMIN GRAHAM\n","1894–1976\n","Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend\n","the thought that he hoped every day to do “something foolish, something\n","creative and something generous.”\n","The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack-\n","aging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or \n","self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was\n","unfailingly gentle.\n","Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as\n","measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-\n","pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.\n","But over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure\n","and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-\n","sible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security\n","analysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months\n","after publication, Ben’s principles have remained sound—their value often\n","enhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that\n","demolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness\n","brought unfailing rewards to his followers—even to those with natural\n","abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-\n","ing counsels of brilliance or fashion.\n","A remarkable aspect of Ben’s dominance of his professional field was\n","that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-\n","trates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of\n","an intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have\n","never met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,\n","unending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a\n","form applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his\n","thinking in any field a delight.\n","But his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond\n","all others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each\n","relationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there\n","was an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,\n","and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to\n","go. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.\n","Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit\n","under. Ben Graham was such a man.\n","Reprinted from the Financial Analysts Journal, November/December 1976.\n","x\n","A Note About Benjamin Graham\n","by Jason Zweig\n","Who was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?\n","Graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was\n","also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham,\n","money managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by\n","superstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s Security Analysis\n","was the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-\n","fession.1\n","And The Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for\n","individual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that\n","are essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on\n","investing ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor\n","was the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub\n","reporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner\n","or later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-\n","fered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,\n","after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market\n","that began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investor reads more prophet-\n","ically than ever.)\n","Graham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the\n","anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and\n","psychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on\n","May 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and\n","figurines.2 The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At\n","first they lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-\n","1 Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.\n","2 The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,\n","when German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.\n","xi\n","A Note About Benjamin Graham\n","erness—on upper Fifth Avenue. But Ben’s father died in 1903, the\n","porcelain business faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty.\n","Ben’s mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-\n","ing money to trade stocks “on margin,” she was wiped out in the crash\n","of 1907. For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of\n","cashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, “Is\n","Dorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?”\n","Fortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his \n","brilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his\n","class. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three departments—\n","English, philosophy, and mathematics—asked him to join the faculty.\n","He was all of 20 years old.\n","Instead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.\n","He started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,\n","then a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-\n","nership.\n","The Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In\n","April 1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for\n","Savold Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by\n","October, the company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock\n","was worthless.\n","Graham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic,\n","almost molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure\n","reports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-\n","mission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at $65\n","per share—held at least $80 per share in high-quality bonds. (He\n","bought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and\n","came away with $110 per share three years later.)\n","Despite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of\n","1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting\n","bargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact\n","record of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in\n","1956, his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually,\n","versus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-\n","term track records on Wall Street history.3\n","3 Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)\n","that Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his\n","own right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new investors. I am\n","A Note About Benjamin Graham\n","xii\n","How did Graham do it? Combining his extraordinary intellectual\n","powers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham\n","developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they\n","were during his lifetime:\n","•\n","A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an\n","ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value\n","that does not depend on its share price.\n","•\n","The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-\n","able optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified\n","pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor\n","is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\n","•\n","The future value of every investment is a function of its present\n","price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.\n","•\n","No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever\n","eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what\n","Graham called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no mat-\n","ter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize\n","your odds of error.\n","•\n","The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you\n","become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith,\n","and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady\n","advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your\n","discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood\n","swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your invest-\n","ments behave is much less important than how you behave.\n","The goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investor is to apply\n","Graham’s ideas to today’s financial markets while leaving his text\n","entirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).4 After\n","each of Graham’s chapters you’ll find a new commentary. In these\n","reader’s guides, I’ve added recent examples that should show you just\n","how relevant—and how liberating—Graham’s principles remain today.\n","grateful to Walter Schloss for providing data essential to estimating \n","Graham-Newman’s returns. The 20% annual average return that Graham\n","cites in his Postscript (p. 532) appears not to take management fees into\n","account.\n","4 The text reproduced here is the Fourth Revised Edition, updated by Gra-\n","ham in 1971–1972 and initially published in 1973.\n","xiii\n","A Note About Benjamin Graham\n","I envy you the excitement and enlightenment of reading Graham’s\n","masterpiece for the first time—or even the third or fourth time. Like all\n","classics, it alters how we view the world and renews itself by educat-\n","ing us. And the more you read it, the better it gets. With Graham as\n","your guide, you are guaranteed to become a vastly more intelligent\n","investor.\n","INTRODUCTION:\n","What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n","The purpose of this book is to supply, in a form suitable for lay-\n","men, guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment pol-\n","icy. Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of\n","analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment\n","principles and investors’ attitudes. We shall, however, provide a\n","number of condensed comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in\n","pairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list—\n","in order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements\n","involved in specific choices of common stocks.\n","But much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns\n","of financial markets, in some cases running back over many\n","decades. To invest intelligently in securities one should be fore-\n","armed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of\n","bonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying condi-\n","tions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s\n","own experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to\n","Wall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do\n","not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\n","Our text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-\n","tors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all\n","but forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a\n","“how to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to\n","riches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up\n","what we have just said by a bit of financial history—especially\n","since there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-\n","mactic year 1929 John J. Raskob, a most important figure nationally\n","as well as on Wall Street, extolled the blessings of capitalism in an\n","article in the Ladies’ Home Journal, entitled “Everybody Ought to Be\n","1\n","Rich.”* His thesis was that savings of only $15 per month invested\n","in good common stocks—with dividends reinvested—would pro-\n","duce an estate of $80,000 in twenty years against total contributions\n","of only $3,600. If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was\n","indeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our\n","rough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks\n","making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—indicates\n","that if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948,\n","the investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been\n","worth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise\n","of $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such\n","optimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should\n","remark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation\n","would have been better than 8% compounded annually—and this\n","despite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases\n","with the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948\n","closing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive\n","argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong\n","common stocks through thick and thin—a program known as \n","“dollar-cost averaging.”\n","Since our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant\n","for those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided\n","by charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the\n","right moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to\n","nearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should\n","buy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell\n","because it has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business\n","sense everywhere else, and it is most unlikely that it can lead to\n","2\n","Introduction\n","* Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical com-\n","pany, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He also\n","served as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the driving\n","force behind the construction of the Empire State Building. Calculations by\n","finance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s plan would have\n","grown to just under $9,000 after 20 years, although inflation would have\n","eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent look at Raskob’s views on\n","long-term stock investing, see the essay by financial adviser William Bern-\n","stein at www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.\n","lasting success on Wall Street. In our own stock-market experience\n","and observation, extending over 50 years, we have not known a\n","single person who has consistently or lastingly made money by\n","thus “following the market.” We do not hesitate to declare that this\n","approach is as fallacious as it is popular. We shall illustrate what\n","we have just said—though, of course this should not be taken as\n","proof—by a later brief discussion of the famous Dow theory for\n","trading in the stock market.*\n","Since its first publication in 1949, revisions of The Intelligent\n","Investor have appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In\n","updating the current version we shall have to deal with quite a\n","number of new developments since the 1965 edition was written.\n","These include:\n","1.\n","An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade\n","bonds.\n","2.\n","A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common\n","stocks, ending in May 1970. This was the highest percentage\n","decline in some 30 years. (Countless issues of lower quality\n","had a much larger shrinkage.)\n","3.\n","A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer’s prices,\n","which gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-\n","eral business in 1970.\n","4.\n","The rapid development of “conglomerate” companies, fran-\n","chise operations, and other relative novelties in business and\n","finance. (These include a number of tricky devices such as “let-\n","ter stock,” 1 proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading\n","names, use of foreign banks, and others.)†\n","What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n","3\n","* Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and pp. 191–192.\n","For more detail on the Dow Theory, see http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/\n","dow/dowpage.html.\n","† Mutual funds bought “letter stock” in private transactions, then immedi-\n","ately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s definition\n","on p. 579). That enabled these “go-go” funds to report unsustainably high\n","returns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n","cracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no longer a concern for fund\n","investors. Stock-option warrants are explained in Chapter 16.\n","5.\n","Bankruptcy of our largest railroad, excessive short- and long-\n","term debt of many formerly strongly entrenched companies,\n","and even a disturbing problem of solvency among Wall Street\n","houses.*\n","6.\n","The advent of the “performance” vogue in the management of\n","investment funds, including some bank-operated trust funds,\n","with disquieting results.\n","These phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some\n","will require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ-\n","ous edition. The underlying principles of sound investment should\n","not alter from decade to decade, but the application of these princi-\n","ples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha-\n","nisms and climate.\n","The last statement was put to the test during the writing of the\n","present edition, the first draft of which was finished in January\n","1971. At that time the DJIA was in a strong recovery from its 1970\n","low of 632 and was advancing toward a 1971 high of 951, with\n","attendant general optimism. As the last draft was finished, in\n","November 1971, the market was in the throes of a new decline, car-\n","rying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its\n","future. We have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general\n","attitude toward sound investment policy, which remains substan-\n","tially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949.\n","The extent of the market’s shrinkage in 1969–70 should have\n","served to dispel an illusion that had been gaining ground dur-\n","ing the past two decades. This was that leading common stocks\n","could be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not\n","only of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon\n","be recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev-\n","4\n","Introduction\n","* The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in the\n","United States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970—shocking\n","investors, who had never expected such a giant company to go under (see\n","p. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham had in mind\n","were Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see pp. 425 and\n","463). The “problem of solvency” on Wall Street emerged between 1968\n","and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went bust.\n","els. That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has\n","“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock\n","investors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-\n","haps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.\n","In the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,\n","especially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the\n","last market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in\n","itself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there\n","was now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment\n","funds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously\n","overvalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who\n","needs to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for\n","great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-\n","ably leads to disaster.\n","The major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the\n","huge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967\n","the investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much\n","income from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-\n","tive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%\n","on highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.\n","(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of\n","1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949\n","the figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only\n","2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.2 In previous editions we have\n","consistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s\n","portfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general\n","a 50–50 division between the two media. We must now consider\n","whether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock\n","yields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-\n","tionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-\n","tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision\n","here. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*\n","What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n","5\n","* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-\n","ing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones\n","Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is not all that\n","different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The income generated\n","by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981.\n","In the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds\n","of investors to whom this book was addressed—the “defensive”\n","and the “enterprising.” The defensive (or passive) investor will\n","place his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or\n","losses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and\n","the need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait of\n","the enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness\n","to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both\n","sound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades\n","an enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhile\n","reward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average\n","return than that realized by the passive investor. We have some\n","doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to\n","the active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or the\n","years after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue to\n","devote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as\n","they existed in former periods and may return.\n","It has long been the prevalent view that the art of success-\n","ful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that \n","are most likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the\n","most promising companies in these industries. For example, smart\n","investors—or their smart advisers—would long ago have recog-\n","nized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a\n","whole and of International Business Machines in particular. And\n","similarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-\n","panies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To\n","bring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that\n","we included first in the 1949 edition of this book.\n","Such an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport\n","stocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than\n","the trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the\n","value of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls\n","lurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive\n","technique that will help him along his path.*\n","6\n","Introduction\n","* “Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement in the late\n","1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later. Among\n","the hottest mutual funds of that era were Aeronautical Securities and the\n","The pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry\n","we mentioned. It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of\n","air traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this\n","factor their shares became a favorite choice of the investment\n","funds. But despite the expansion of revenues—at a pace even\n","greater than in the computer industry—a combination of techno-\n","logical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat-\n","ing and even disastrous profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a\n","new high in traffic figures, the airlines sustained a loss of some\n","$200 million for their shareholders. (They had shown losses also in\n","1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these companies once again showed a\n","greater decline in 1969–70 than did the general market. The record\n","shows that even the highly paid full-time experts of the mutual\n","funds were completely wrong about the fairly short-term future of\n","a major and nonesoteric industry.\n","On the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial\n","investments and substantial gains in IBM, the combination of its\n","apparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about\n","its rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3%\n","of their funds in this wonderful performer. Hence the effect of \n","this excellent choice on their overall results was by no means \n","decisive. Furthermore, many—if not most—of their investments in\n","computer-industry companies other than IBM appear to have been\n","unprofitable. From these two broad examples we draw two morals\n","for our readers:\n","1.\n","Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not\n","translate into obvious profits for investors.\n","2.\n","The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and\n","concentrating on the most promising companies in the most\n","promising industries.\n","What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n","7\n","Missiles-Rockets-Jets & Automation Fund. They, like the stocks they owned,\n","turned out to be an investing disaster. It is commonly accepted today that\n","the cumulative earnings of the airline industry over its entire history have\n","been negative. The lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid\n","buying airline stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty”\n","that any industry will outperform all others in the future.\n","The author did not follow this approach in his financial career as\n","fund manager, and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much\n","encouragement to those who may wish to try it.\n","What then will we aim to accomplish in this book? Our main\n","objective will be to guide the reader against the areas of possible\n","substantial error and to develop policies with which he will be\n","comfortable. We shall say quite a bit about the psychology of\n","investors. For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his\n","worst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear investor, is\n","not in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves. . . .”) This\n","has proved the more true over recent decades as it has become\n","more necessary for conservative investors to acquire common\n","stocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement\n","and the temptations of the stock market. By arguments, examples,\n","and exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper\n","mental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.\n","We have seen much more money made and kept by “ordinary peo-\n","ple” who were temperamentally well suited for the investment\n","process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they\n","had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-\n","market lore.\n","Additionally, we hope to implant in the reader a tendency to\n","measure or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at\n","some price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price\n","they would be so dear that they should be sold. The habit of relat-\n","ing what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in\n","investment. In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago\n","we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-\n","ceries, not as they bought their perfume. The really dreadful losses\n","of the past few years (and on many similar occasions before) were\n","realized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to\n","ask “How much?”\n","In June 1970 the question “How much?” could be answered by\n","the magic figure 9.40%—the yield obtainable on new offerings of\n","high-grade public-utility bonds. This has now dropped to about\n","7.3%, but even that return tempts us to ask, “Why give any other\n","answer?” But there are other possible answers, and these must be\n","carefully considered. Besides which, we repeat that both we and\n","our readers must be prepared in advance for the possibly quite dif-\n","ferent conditions of, say, 1973–1977.\n","8\n","Introduction\n","We shall therefore present in some detail a positive program for\n","common-stock investment, part of which is within the purview of\n","both classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enter-\n","prising group. Strangely enough, we shall suggest as one of our\n","chief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues\n","selling not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for \n","this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-\n","cal. Experience has taught us that, while there are many good\n","growth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of\n","such shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations\n","of the stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of \n","public-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always\n","consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding\n","businesses, acquired at a rational price—regardless of what the\n","stock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such\n","a conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting\n","adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated\n","growth.\n","The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally\n","appreciated. A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved\n","by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to\n","improve this easily attainable standard requires much application\n","and more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just a\n","little extra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment\n","program, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you\n","may well find that you have done worse.\n","Since anyone—by just buying and holding a representative\n","list—can equal the performance of the market averages, it would\n","seem a comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but as\n","a matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail\n","is surprisingly large. Even the majority of the investment funds,\n","with all their experienced personnel, have not performed so well\n","What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n","9\n","* Tangible assets include a company’s physical property (like real estate,\n","factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial balances (such\n","as cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable). Among the ele-\n","ments not included in tangible assets are brands, copyrights, patents, fran-\n","chises, goodwill, and trademarks. To see how to calculate tangible-asset\n","value, see footnote † on p. 198.\n","over the years as has the general market. Allied to the foregoing \n","is the record of the published stock-market predictions of the \n","brokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated\n","forecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing\n","of a coin.\n","In writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of\n","investment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have\n","been emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-\n","sified list of leading common stocks—which any investor can carry\n","out with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe\n","and sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng-\n","ing difficulties, especially in the area of temperament. Before\n","attempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself\n","and of his advisers—particularly as to whether they have a clear\n","concept of the differences between investment and speculation and\n","between market price and underlying value.\n","A strong-minded approach to investment, firmly based on the\n","margin-of-safety principle, can yield handsome rewards. But a\n","decision to try for these emoluments rather than for the assured\n","fruits of defensive investment should not be made without much\n","self-examination.\n","A final retrospective thought. When the young author entered\n","Wall Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next\n","half-century had in store. (The stock market did not even suspect\n","that a World War was to break out in two months, and close down\n","the New York Stock Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves the\n","richest and most powerful country on earth, but beset by all sorts\n","of major problems and more apprehensive than confident of the\n","future. Yet if we confine our attention to American investment\n","experience, there is some comfort to be gleaned from the last 57\n","years. Through all their vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-\n","shaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound\n","investment principles produced generally sound results. We must\n","act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.\n","Note to the Reader: This book does not address itself to the overall\n","financial policy of savers and investors; it deals only with that \n","portion of their funds which they are prepared to place in mar-\n","ketable (or redeemable) securities, that is, in bonds and stocks.\n","10\n","Introduction\n","Consequently we do not discuss such important media as savings\n","and time desposits, savings-and-loan-association accounts, life\n","insurance, annuities, and real-estate mortgages or equity owner-\n","ship. The reader should bear in mind that when he finds the word\n","“now,” or the equivalent, in the text, it refers to late 1971 or \n","early 1972.\n","What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n","11\n","COMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTION\n","If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;\n","that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under\n","them.\n","—Henry David Thoreau, Walden\n","Notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not\n","tell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.\n","Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:\n","•\n","how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;\n","•\n","how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;\n","•\n","how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most\n","investors from reaching their full potential.\n","Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks\n","seemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you could\n","lose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,\n","many of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their value\n","or more. Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%\n","just to get back to where you started.1 Taking a foolish risk can put\n","you so deep in the hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out. That’s\n","why Graham constantly emphasizes the importance of avoiding\n","losses—not just in Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warn-\n","ing that he has woven throughout his entire text.\n","But no matter how careful you are, the price of your investments\n","will go down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk,\n","12\n","1 To put this statement in perspective, consider how often you are likely to\n","buy a stock at $30 and be able to sell it at $600.\n","Commentary on the Introduction\n","13\n","Graham will show you how to manage it—and how to get your fears\n","under control.\n","A R E  Y O U  A N  I N T E L L I G E N T  I N V E S T O R ?\n","Now let’s answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra-\n","ham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of this\n","book, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of\n","intelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means\n","being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to\n","harness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,\n","explains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain.” 2\n","There’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to\n","make an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management\n","L.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer \n","scientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than \n","$2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market\n","would return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming\n","more and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money\n","that its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3\n","And back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in\n","the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that\n","the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that\n","he “could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the\n","madness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-\n","eting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in\n","the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much\n","higher price—and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in today’s\n","money). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words\n","“South Sea” in his presence.4\n","2 Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (Harper & Row, 1949), p. 4.\n","3 A “hedge fund” is a pool of money, largely unregulated by the government,\n","invested aggressively for wealthy clients.

But, in Graham’s terms,\n","Newton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the\n","crowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist acted\n","like a fool.\n","In short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because you’re\n","stupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t developed the\n","emotional discipline that successful investing requires. In Chapter 8,\n","Graham describes how to enhance your intelligence by harnessing\n","your emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of irrational-\n","ity.

The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,\n","not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices\n","fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks\n","more costly to buy.

In particular we wish to develop at the\n","outset our concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individ-\n","ual, nonprofessional investor.\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","What do we mean by “investor”? Throughout this book the\n","term will be used in contradistinction to “speculator.” As far back\n","as 1934, in our textbook Security Analysis,1 we attempted a precise\n","formulation of the difference between the two, as follows: “An\n","investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-\n","ises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not\n","meeting these requirements are speculative.”\n","While we have clung tenaciously to this definition over the\n","ensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that\n","have occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.\n","After the great market decline of 1929–1932 all common stocks\n","were widely regarded as speculative by nature. (A leading author-\n","ity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.2)\n","Thus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that\n","it gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.\n","Now our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our\n","readers from accepting the common jargon which applies the term\n","“investor” to anybody and everybody in the stock market. In our\n","last edition we cited the following headline of a front-page article\n","of our leading financial journal in June 1962:\n","18\n","SMALL INVESTORS BEARISH, THEY ARE SELLING ODD-LOTS SHORT\n","In October 1970 the same journal had an editorial critical of what it\n","called “reckless investors,” who this time were rushing in on the\n","buying side.\n","These quotations well illustrate the confusion that has been\n","dominant for many years in the use of the words investment and\n","speculation. Think of our suggested definition of investment given\n","above, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an\n","inexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what\n","he is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that he\n","will be able to buy them back at a much lower price. (It is not irrel-\n","evant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market\n","had already experienced a decline of major size, and was now get-\n","ting ready for an even greater upswing. It was about as poor a time\n","as possible for selling short.) In a more general sense, the later-used\n","phrase “reckless investors” could be regarded as a laughable con-\n","tradiction in terms—something like “spendthrift misers”—were\n","this misuse of language not so mischievous.\n","The newspaper employed the word “investor” in these\n","instances because, in the easy language of Wall Street, everyone\n","who buys or sells a security has become an investor, regardless of\n","what he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price, or whether for\n","cash or on margin. Compare this with the attitude of the public\n","toward common stocks in 1948, when over 90% of those queried\n","expressed themselves as opposed to the purchase of common\n","stocks.3 About half gave as their reason “not safe, a gamble,” and\n","about half, the reason “not familiar with.”* It is indeed ironical\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","19\n","* The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the University of\n","Michigan and was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, July, 1948.\n","People were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to spend his money. He\n","can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it. What do you think\n","would be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadays—put it in\n","the bank, buy savings bonds with it, invest it in real estate, or buy common\n","stock with it?” Only 4% thought common stock would offer a “satisfactory”\n","return; 26% considered it “not safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through\n","1958, the stock market earned one of its highest 10-year returns in history,\n","(though not surprising) that common-stock purchases of all kinds\n","were quite generally regarded as highly speculative or risky at a\n","time when they were selling on a most attractive basis, and due\n","soon to begin their greatest advance in history; conversely the very\n","fact they had advanced to what were undoubtedly dangerous lev-\n","els as judged by past experience later transformed them into “invest-\n","ments,” and the entire stock-buying public into “investors.”\n","The distinction between investment and speculation in common\n","stocks has always been a useful one and its disappearance is a\n","cause for concern. We have often said that Wall Street as an institu-\n","tion would be well advised to reinstate this distinction and to\n","emphasize it in all its dealings with the public. Otherwise the stock\n","exchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses,\n","which those who suffered them had not been properly warned\n","against. Ironically, once more, much of the recent financial embar-\n","rassment of some stock-exchange firms seems to have come from\n","the inclusion of speculative common stocks in their own capital\n","funds. We trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably\n","clear idea of the risks that are inherent in common-stock commit-\n","ments—risks which are inseparable from the opportunities of\n","profit that they offer, and both of which must be allowed for in the\n","investor’s calculations.\n","What we have just said indicates that there may no longer be\n","such a thing as a simon-pure investment policy comprising repre-\n","sentative common stocks—in the sense that one can always wait to\n","buy them at a price that involves no risk of a market or “quota-\n","tional” loss large enough to be disquieting. In most periods the\n","investor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his\n","common-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component\n","within minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog-\n","ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.\n","Two paragraphs should be added about stock speculation per\n","se, as distinguished from the speculative component now inherent\n","20\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","averaging 18.7% annually. In a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a\n","poll conducted by BusinessWeek at year-end 2002 found that only 24% of\n","investors were willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios,\n","down from 47% just three years earlier.\n","in most representative common stocks. Outright speculation is \n","neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the\n","pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and\n","unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub-\n","stantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein\n","must be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as\n","there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which\n","speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1)\n","speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri-\n","ously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge\n","and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you\n","can afford to lose.\n","In our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates\n","on margin† should recognize that he is ipso facto speculating, and it\n","is his broker’s duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a\n","so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any\n","way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling. Speculation\n","is always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead\n","of the game. If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—\n","the smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this\n","purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","21\n","* Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without speculation, untested\n","new companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier times, the Edison Electric\n","Light Co.) would never be able to raise the necessary capital for expansion.\n","The alluring, long-shot chance of a huge gain is the grease that lubricates\n","the machinery of innovation. Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never elimi-\n","nated) every time a stock is bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary\n","risk that this stock may go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual\n","risk—the chance that the stock he just sold may go up!\n","† A margin account enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow\n","from the brokerage firm.

In general what\n","course should he follow and what return can he expect under\n","“average normal conditions”—if such conditions really exist? To\n","answer these questions we shall consider first what we wrote on\n","the subject seven years ago, next what significant changes have\n","occurred since then in the underlying factors governing the\n","investor’s expectable return, and finally what he should do and\n","what he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.\n","1. What We Said Six Years Ago\n","We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between\n","high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion\n","held in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the\n","converse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;\n","that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion\n","between the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when\n","market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As\n","an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock\n","component to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,”\n","and conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he\n","felt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly\n","attractive.”\n","In 1965 the investor could obtain about 41⁄2% on high-grade tax-\n","able bonds and 31⁄4% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return\n","on leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about\n","3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that “at\n","normal levels of the market” the investor should be able to obtain\n","an initial dividend return of between 31⁄2% and 41⁄2% on his stock\n","purchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-\n","ing value (and in the “normal market price”) of a representative\n","22\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","stock list of about the same amount, giving a return from divi-\n","dends and appreciation combined of about 71⁄2% per year. The half\n","and half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6%\n","before income tax. We added that the stock component should\n","carry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power\n","caused by large-scale inflation.\n","It should be pointed out that the above arithmetic indicated\n","expectation of a much lower rate of advance in the stock market\n","than had been realized between 1949 and 1964. That rate had aver-\n","aged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it\n","was quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly\n","satisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people\n","were willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate\n","of advance in the past means that stock prices are “now too high,”\n","and hence that “the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not\n","very good but bad results for the future.” 4\n","2. What Has Happened Since 1964\n","The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on\n","first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since\n","been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The\n","obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄2% and\n","even more against 41⁄2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend\n","return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-\n","ket decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is\n","less than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going\n","interest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the\n","market price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this\n","period.\n","There is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we\n","discussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be\n","too high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not\n","consider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to\n","the price of high-grade bonds. (Neither did anyone else that we\n","know of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that “a long-term bond may vary\n","widely in price in response to changes in interest rates.” In the light\n","of what has since happened we think that this warning—with\n","attendant examples—was insufficiently stressed. For the fact is that\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","23\n","if the investor had a given sum in the DJIA at its closing price of\n","874 in 1964 he would have had a small profit thereon in late 1971;\n","even at the lowest level (631) in 1970 his indicated loss would have\n","been less than that shown on good long-term bonds. On the other\n","hand, if he had confined his bond-type investments to U.S. savings\n","bonds, short-term corporate issues, or savings accounts, he would\n","have had no loss in market value of his principal during this period\n","and he would have enjoyed a higher income return than was\n","offered by good stocks. It turned out, therefore, that true “cash\n","equivalents” proved to be better investments in 1964 than common\n","stocks—in spite of the inflation experience that in theory should\n","have favored stocks over cash. The decline in quoted principal\n","value of good longer-term bonds was due to developments in the\n","money market, an abstruse area which ordinarily does not have an\n","important bearing on the investment policy of individuals.\n","This is just another of an endless series of experiences over time\n","that have demonstrated that the future of security prices is never\n","predictable.* Almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than\n","stock prices, and investors generally could buy good bonds of any\n","maturity without having to worry about changes in their market\n","value. There were a few exceptions to this rule, and the period after\n","1964 proved to be one of them. We shall have more to say about\n","change in bond prices in a later chapter.\n","3. Expectations and Policy in Late 1971 and Early 1972\n","Toward the end of 1971 it was possible to obtain 8% taxable\n","interest on good medium-term corporate bonds, and 5.7% tax-free\n","on good state or municipal securities. In the shorter-term field the\n","investor could realize about 6% on U.S. government issues due in\n","five years. In the latter case the buyer need not be concerned about\n","24\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of investing \n","experts is saying: The future of security prices is never predictable. And as\n","you read ahead in the book, notice how everything else Graham tells you is\n","designed to help you grapple with that truth. Since you cannot predict the\n","behavior of the markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own\n","behavior.\n","a possible loss in market value, since he is sure of full repayment,\n","including the 6% interest return, at the end of a comparatively\n","short holding period. The DJIA at its recurrent price level of 900 in\n","1971 yields only 3.5%.\n","Let us assume that now, as in the past, the basic policy decision\n","to be made is how to divide the fund between high-grade bonds\n","(or other so-called “cash equivalents”) and leading DJIA-type\n","stocks. What course should the investor follow under present con-\n","ditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant\n","upward or a significant downward movement for some time in the\n","future? First let us point out that if there is no serious adverse\n","change, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-\n","rent 3.5% dividend return on his stocks and also on an average\n","annual appreciation of about 4%. As we shall explain later this\n","appreciation is based essentially on the reinvestment by the vari-\n","ous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-\n","tributed profits. On a before-tax basis the combined return of his\n","stocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-\n","est on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return\n","on stocks would work out at some 5.3%.5 This would be about the\n","same as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.\n","These expectations are much less favorable for stocks against\n","bonds than they were in our 1964 analysis. (That conclusion fol-\n","lows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up\n","much more than stock yields since 1964.) We must never lose sight\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","25\n","* How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems, very\n","well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks earned\n","an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the time period\n","for his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-\n","year time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6% annually over this\n","period, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his\n","chapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the “Gordon equation,”\n","which essentially holds that the stock market’s future return is the sum of the\n","current dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield\n","of just under 2% in early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around\n","2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly\n","6% is plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)\n","of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds\n","are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-\n","dends and price appreciation on stocks. Consequently we are\n","forced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bond\n","investment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If we\n","could be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise\n","the defensive investor to put all his money in bonds and none in\n","common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-\n","cantly in favor of stocks.\n","But of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-\n","ter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediately\n","think of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In\n","the next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experience\n","with inflation in the United States during this century would not\n","support the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials\n","in yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider it\n","remote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another\n","would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a\n","fixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility—\n","which we also consider highly unlikely—that American business\n","will become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-\n","tify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.\n","Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness\n","another great speculative rise in the stock market without a real\n","justification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, and\n","perhaps others we haven’t thought of, might cause the investor to\n","regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable\n","yield levels.\n","Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-\n","ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy\n","26\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were\n","introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice\n","for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise\n","in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing the\n","investor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee\n","and, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For\n","more details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)\n","for defensive investors—namely that at all times they have a signif-\n","icant part of their funds in bond-type holdings and a significant\n","part also in equities. It is still true that they may choose between\n","maintaining a simple 50–50 division between the two components\n","or a ratio, dependent on their judgment, varying between a mini-\n","mum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of either. We shall give our\n","more detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter.\n","Since at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks\n","is nearly the same as that from bonds, the presently expectable\n","return (including growth of stock values) for the investor would\n","change little regardless of how he divides his fund between the\n","two components. As calculated above, the aggregate return from\n","both parts should be about 7.8% before taxes or 5.5% on a tax-free\n","(or estimated tax-paid) basis. A return of this order is appreciably\n","higher than that realized by the typical conservative investor over\n","most of the long-term past. It may not seem attractive in relation to\n","the 14%, or so, return shown by common stocks during the 20\n","years of the predominantly bull market after 1949. But it should be\n","remembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIA had\n","advanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had\n","about doubled. Hence the greater part of the impressive market\n","record for that period was based on a change in investors’ and\n","speculators’ attitudes rather than in underlying corporate values.\n","To that extent it might well be called a “bootstrap operation.”\n","In discussing the common-stock portfolio of the defensive\n","investor, we have spoken only of leading issues of the type\n","included in the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-\n","age. We have done this for convenience, and not to imply that these\n","30 issues alone are suitable for purchase by him. Actually, there are\n","many other companies of quality equal to or excelling the average\n","of the Dow Jones list; these would include a host of public utilities\n","(which have a separate Dow Jones average to represent them).* But\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","27\n","* Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones Industrial\n","Average are the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index (the “S & P”) and the\n","Wilshire 5000 index. The S & P focuses on 500 large, well-known compa-\n","nies that make up roughly 70% of the total value of the U.S. equity market.\n","The Wilshire 5000 follows the returns of nearly every significant, publicly\n","the major point here is that the defensive investor’s overall results\n","are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or rep-\n","resentative list than from another, or—more accurately—that nei-\n","ther he nor his advisers could predict with certainty whatever\n","differences would ultimately develop. It is true that the art of skill-\n","ful or shrewd investment is supposed to lie particularly in the\n","selection of issues that will give better results than the general mar-\n","ket. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the\n","ability of defensive investors generally to get better than average\n","results—which in fact would mean to beat their own overall per-\n","formance.* (Our skepticism extends to the management of large\n","funds by experts.)\n","Let us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem\n","to prove the opposite. Between December 1960 and December 1970\n","the DJIA advanced from 616 to 839, or 36%. But in the same period\n","the much larger Standard & Poor’s weighted index of 500 stocks\n","rose from 58.11 to 92.15, or 58%. Obviously the second group had\n","proved a better “buy” than the first. But who would have been so\n","rash as to predict in 1960 that what seemed like a miscellaneous\n","assortment of all sorts of common stocks would definitely outper-\n","form the aristocratic “thirty tyrants” of the Dow? All this proves,\n","we insist, that only rarely can one make dependable predictions\n","about price changes, absolute or relative.\n","We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot\n","be given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than\n","average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any\n","sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.† The\n","contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. The defensive\n","investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies\n","with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial\n","condition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such\n","28\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","traded stock in America, roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest compa-\n","nies account for most of the total value of the index, the return of the\n","Wilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the S & P 500. Several low-\n","cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these indexes as a\n","single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)\n","* See pp. 363–366 and pp. 376–380.\n","† For greater detail, see Chapter 6.\n","a list.) Aggressive investors may buy other types of common\n","stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-\n","lished by intelligent analysis.\n","To conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-\n","tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the\n","purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an\n","alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might\n","also utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled\n","funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,\n","if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-\n","ment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration\n","of his investment program along standard lines. The third is the\n","device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the\n","practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars\n","each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when\n","the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up\n","with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-\n","ing, this method is an application of a broader approach known as\n","“formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug-\n","gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks\n","between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-\n","tionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the\n","defensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later\n","chapters.*\n","Results to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor\n","Our enterprising security buyer, of course, will desire and\n","expect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive\n","companion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be\n","worse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,\n","and native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead\n","of profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions,\n","become indistinguishable from handicaps. Thus it is most essential\n","that the enterprising investor start with a clear conception as to\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","29\n","* For more advice on “well-established investment funds,” see Chapter 9.\n","“Professional administration” by “a recognized investment-counsel firm” is\n","discussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.\n","which courses of action offer reasonable chances of success and\n","which do not.\n","First let us consider several ways in which investors and specu-\n","lators generally have endeavored to obtain better than average\n","results. These include:\n","1. Trading in the market. This usually means buying stocks\n","when the market has been advancing and selling them after it has\n","turned downward. The stocks selected are likely to be among those\n","which have been “behaving” better than the market average. A\n","small number of professionals frequently engage in short selling.\n","Here they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the\n","established mechanism of the stock exchanges. Their object is to\n","benefit from a subsequent decline in the price of these issues, by\n","buying them back at a price lower than they sold them for. (As our\n","quotation from the Wall Street Journal on p. 19 indicates, even\n","“small investors”—perish the term!—sometimes try their unskilled\n","hand at short selling.)\n","2. Short-term selectivity. This means buying stocks of compa-\n","nies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings,\n","or for which some other favorable development is anticipated.\n","3. Long-term selectivity. Here the usual emphasis is on an\n","excellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-\n","tinue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose\n","companies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are\n","expected to establish a high earning power later. (Such companies\n","belong frequently in some technological area—e.g., computers,\n","drugs, electronics—and they often are developing new processes\n","or products that are deemed to be especially promising.)\n","We have already expressed a negative view about the investor’s\n","overall chances of success in these areas of activity. The first we\n","have ruled out, on both theoretical and realistic grounds, from the\n","domain of investment. Stock trading is not an operation “which, on\n","thorough analysis, offers safety of principal and a satisfactory\n","return.” More will be said on stock trading in a later chapter.*\n","30\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* See Chapter 8.\n","In his endeavor to select the most promising stocks either for the\n","near term or the longer future, the investor faces obstacles of two\n","kinds—the first stemming from human fallibility and the second\n","from the nature of his competition. He may be wrong in his esti-\n","mate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price\n","may already fully reflect what he is anticipating. In the area of\n","near-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are\n","generally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to\n","the extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-\n","ered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of\n","this year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for\n","next year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for\n","the same reason.\n","In choosing stocks for their long-term prospects, the investor’s\n","handicaps are basically the same. The possibility of outright error\n","in the prediction—which we illustrated by our airlines example on\n","p. 6—is no doubt greater than when dealing with near-term earn-\n","ings. Because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts, it is\n","theoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making\n","correct predictions when Wall Street as a whole is making incorrect\n","ones. But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors\n","could count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-\n","fessional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term\n","future earnings?\n","We are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-\n","sion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average\n","results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently\n","sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.\n","Are there any such policies available for the enterprising\n","investor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there\n","are broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in\n","practice as well. Everyone knows that speculative stock move-\n","ments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-\n","eral market and at all times in at least some of the individual\n","issues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because\n","of lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice. We can go fur-\n","ther and assert that in an astonishingly large proportion of the\n","trading in common stocks, those engaged therein don’t appear to\n","know—in polite terms—one part of their anatomy from another. In\n","this book we shall point out numerous examples of (past) dis-\n","Investment versus Speculation\n","31\n","crepancies between price and value. Thus it seems that any intelli-\n","gent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable\n","picnic on Wall Street, battening off other people’s foolishness. So it\n","seems, but somehow it doesn’t work out that simply. Buying a neg-\n","lected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves\n","a protracted and patience-trying experience. And selling short a\n","too popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not\n","only of one’s courage and stamina but also of the depth of one’s\n","pocketbook.* The principle is sound, its successful application is\n","not impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.\n","There is also a fairly wide group of “special situations,” which\n","over many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return\n","of 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew\n","their way around in this field. They include intersecurity arbi-\n","trages, payouts or workouts in liquidations, protected hedges of\n","certain kinds. The most typical case is a projected merger or acqui-\n","sition which offers a substantially higher value for certain shares\n","than their price on the date of the announcement. The number of\n","such deals increased greatly in recent years, and it should have\n","been a highly profitable period for the cognoscenti. But with the\n","multiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of\n","obstacles to mergers and of deals that didn’t go through; quite a\n","few individual losses were thus realized in these once-reliable\n","operations. Perhaps, too, the overall rate of profit was diminished\n","by too much competition.†\n","32\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that its share \n","price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process: First, you bor-\n","row shares from someone who owns them; then you immediately sell the\n","borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with shares you buy later. If the\n","stock drops, you will be able to buy your replacement shares at a lower\n","price. The difference between the price at which you sold your borrowed\n","shares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit\n","(reduced by dividend or interest charges, along with brokerage costs). How-\n","ever, if the stock goes up in price instead of down, your potential loss is\n","unlimited—making short sales unacceptably speculative for most individual\n","investors.\n","† In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts\n","multiplied, Wall Street set up institutional arbitrage desks to profit from any\n","The lessened profitability of these special situations appears one\n","manifestation of a kind of self-destructive process—akin to the law\n","of diminishing returns—which has developed during the lifetime\n","of this book. In 1949 we could present a study of stock-market fluc-\n","tuations over the preceding 75 years, which supported a formula—\n","based on earnings and current interest rates—for determining a\n","level to buy the DJIA below its “central” or “intrinsic” value, \n","and to sell out above such value. It was an application of the gov-\n","erning maxim of the Rothschilds: “Buy cheap and sell dear.”* And\n","it had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained\n","and pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be bought\n","because they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.\n","Alas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. A second illustra-\n","tion is provided by the famous “Dow Theory” of stock-market\n","movements, in a comparison of its indicated splendid results for\n","1897–1933 and its much more questionable performance since\n","1934.\n","A third and final example of the golden opportunities not\n","recently available: A good part of our own operations on Wall\n","Street had been concentrated on the purchase of bargain issues eas-\n","ily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than\n","their share in the net current assets (working capital) alone, not\n","counting the plant account and other assets, and after deducting all\n","liabilities ahead of the stock. It is clear that these issues were selling\n","at a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi-\n","ness.

A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price\n","because somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once\n","put it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of\n","value,” while speculators “base [their] standards of value upon the\n","market price.” 2 For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes\n","is like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham\n","called “quotational” values matter much less.

The “January effect”—the tendency of\n","small stocks to produce big gains around the turn of the year—\n","was widely promoted in scholarly articles and popular books pub-\n","lished in the 1980s. These studies showed that if you piled into\n","small stocks in the second half of December and held them into\n","January, you would beat the market by five to 10 percentage\n","points. That amazed many experts. After all, if it were this easy,\n","surely everyone would hear about it, lots of people would do it,\n","and the opportunity would wither away.\n","What caused the January jolt? First of all, many investors sell\n","their crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can\n","cut their tax bills. Second, professional money managers grow\n","more cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve\n","their outperformance (or minimize their underperformance). That\n","makes them reluctant to buy (or even hang on to) a falling stock.\n","And if an underperforming stock is also small and obscure, a\n","money manager will be even less eager to show it in his year-end\n","Commentary on Chapter 1\n","41\n","9 In 2000 and 2001, Amazon.com and Qualcomm lost a cumulative total of\n","85.8% and 71.3% of their value, respectively.\n","list of holdings. All these factors turn small stocks into momentary\n","bargains; when the tax-driven selling ceases in January, they typi-\n","cally bounce back, producing a robust and rapid gain.\n","The January effect has not withered away, but it has weakened.\n","According to finance professor William Schwert of the University of\n","Rochester, if you had bought small stocks in late December and\n","sold them in early January, you would have beaten the market by 8.5\n","percentage points from 1962 through 1979, by 4.4 points from\n","1980 through 1989, and by 5.8 points from 1990 through 2001.10\n","As more people learned about the January effect, more traders\n","bought small stocks in December, making them less of a bargain\n","and thus reducing their returns.

In the 1994 edition of his influ-\n","ential book, Stocks for the Long Run, finance professor Jeremy Siegel of the\n","Wharton School recommended that “risk-taking” investors should buy on\n","margin, borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135% of their\n","assets into stocks. Even government officials got in on the act: In February\n","1999, the Honorable Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the\n","audience at an investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for any-\n","one to have any money in a bond fund.”\n","restricted by law to high-grade bonds (and a few choice preferred\n","stocks).\n","Our readers must have enough intelligence to recognize that\n","even high-quality stocks cannot be a better purchase than bonds\n","under all conditions—i.e., regardless of how high the stock market\n","may be and how low the current dividend return compared with\n","the rates available on bonds. A statement of this kind would be as\n","absurd as was the contrary one—too often heard years ago—that\n","any bond is safer than any stock. In this chapter we shall try to\n","apply various measurements to the inflation factor, in order to\n","reach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may\n","wisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the\n","price level.\n","In this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our\n","views of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is infla-\n","tion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it\n","has taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-\n","tions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them\n","in confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a\n","condensed historical tabulation that contains much information\n","about changes in the general price level and concomitant changes\n","in the earnings and market value of common stocks. Our figures\n","will begin with 1915, and thus cover 55 years, presented at five-\n","year intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of\n","wartime price controls.)\n","The first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the\n","past—lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and\n","1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with\n","the advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have\n","had three periods of declining prices and then six of advances at\n","varying rates, some rather small. On this showing, the investor\n","should clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent\n","inflation to come.\n","Can we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear\n","answer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It\n","would seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-\n","sistent record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the\n","consumer price level for this period has been 2.5%; that for\n","1965–1970 was 4.5%; that for 1970 alone was 5.4%.

This brings us to the next logical\n","question: Is there a persuasive reason to believe that common\n","stocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in\n","the last five and one-half decades?\n","Our answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common\n","stocks may do better in the future than in the past, but they are far\n","from certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time\n","elements in investment results. The first covers what is likely to\n","occur over the long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second\n","applies to what is likely to happen to the investor—both financially\n","and psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five\n","years or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his\n","satisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-\n","sions what to do next, are all determined not in the retrospect of \n","a lifetime of investment but rather by his experience from year \n","to year.\n","On this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-\n","nection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the\n","movement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious\n","example is the recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of liv-\n","ing was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But\n","both stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since\n","1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in the\n","record of previous five-year periods.\n","Inflation and Corporate Earnings\n","Another and highly important approach to the subject is by a\n","study of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.\n","This has fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic\n","activity, but it has shown no general tendency to advance with\n","wholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen\n","rather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of\n","the period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of\n","more liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended stud-\n","ies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on\n","much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group—\n","The Investor and Inflation\n","51\n","about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares.2\n","Since the market value of these issues is well above their book\n","value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on\n","current market price work out only at some 61⁄4%. (This relation-\n","ship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,”\n","manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual\n","earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)\n","Our figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous\n","chapter* that the investor may assume an average dividend return\n","of about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an apprecia-\n","tion of, say, 4% annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note\n","that each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase\n","the market price by about $1.60.)\n","The reader will object that in the end our calculations make no\n","allowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to\n","result from our projected 3% annual inflation. Our justification is\n","the absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount\n","in the past has had any direct effect on reported per-share earnings.\n","The cold figures demonstrate that all the large gain in the earnings\n","of the DJIA unit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately\n","large growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If\n","inflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effect\n","would have been to increase the “value” of previously existing\n","capital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old\n","capital and therefore on the old and new capital combined. But\n","nothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during\n","which the wholesale price level has advanced nearly 40%. (Busi-\n","ness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than\n","by “consumer prices.”) The only way that inflation can add to \n","common stock values is by raising the rate of earnings on cap-\n","ital investment. On the basis of the past record this has not been \n","the case.\n","In the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompa-\n","nied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It\n","was generally felt that “a little inflation” was helpful to business\n","profits.

Clearly there have been impor-\n","tant offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the\n","real profitability of American corporations as a whole. Perhaps the\n","most important of these have been (1) a rise in wage rates exceed-\n","ing the gains in productivity, and (2) the need for huge amounts \n","of new capital, thus holding down the ratio of sales to capital\n","employed.\n","Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having\n","benefited our corporations and their shareholders, its effect has\n","been quite the opposite.

The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in\n","the overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit\n","on invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World\n","War years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number\n","of companies reported net losses for the year; many became “finan-\n","cially troubled,” and for the first time in three decades there were\n","quite a few important bankruptcy proceedings.

But nothing has happened either\n","to business or to stock prices that can compare with the bear mar-\n","ket and depression of 1929–1932.\n","The Stock-Market Level in Early 1972\n","With a century-long conspectus of stock, prices, earnings, and\n","dividends before our eyes, let us try to draw some conclusions\n","about the level of 900 for the DJIA and 100 for the S & P composite\n","index in January 1972.\n","In each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the\n","stock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the\n","question whether it was too high for conservative purchase. The\n","reader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached\n","on these earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-\n","punishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the\n","various stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also\n","a taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries\n","to reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-\n","els. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959\n","analyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:\n","In 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones\n","level of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that\n","“it was not too high in relation to underlying values.” When we\n","approached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that\n","year had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked\n","ourselves the same question—namely, “whether in our opinion the\n","level of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high\n","for sound investment.” In the light of the subsequent spectacular\n","advance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no\n","means easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-\n","tiveness of the 1953 level. We did say, positively enough, that\n","“from the standpoint of value indications—our chief investment\n","guide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable.”\n","But we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages\n","had advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the\n","72\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","past, and that its absolute level was historically high. Setting these\n","factors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cau-\n","tious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-\n","ularly brilliant counsel. A good prophet would have foreseen that\n","the market level was due to advance an additional 100% in the\n","next five years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if\n","any of those whose business was stock-market forecasting—as\n","ours was not—had any better inkling than we did of what lay\n","ahead.\n","At the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIA at an all-time high\n","of 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be\n","summarized in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition):\n","“In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-\n","ent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous\n","because prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the\n","case the market’s momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to\n","unjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the\n","future in which there will never be any serious losses, and in\n","which, every tyro will be guaranteed a large profit on his stock\n","purchases.”\n","The caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justi-\n","fied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet\n","it was far from fully vindicated. The DJIA advanced to 685 in 1961;\n","then fell a little below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year;\n","advanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic\n","to 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period\n","of six months. At the same time there was a far more serious\n","shrinkage in the most popular “growth stocks”—as evidenced by\n","the striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business\n","Machines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in\n","June 1962.\n","This period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched\n","common stocks of small enterprises—the so-called hot issues—\n","which had been offered to the public at ridiculously high prices\n","and then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to\n","levels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the\n","quotations in just a few months.\n","The collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not\n","disastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps \n","A Century of Stock-Market History\n","73\n","to many more imprudent people who called themselves “in-\n","vestors.” But the turnabout that came later that year was equally\n","unsuspected by the financial community. The stock-market aver-\n","ages resumed their upward course, producing the following\n","sequence:\n","Standard & Poor’s \n","DJIA\n","500-Stock Composite\n","December 1961\n","735\n","72.64\n","June 1962\n","536\n","52.32\n","November 1964\n","892\n","86.28\n","The recovery and new ascent of common-stock prices was\n","indeed remarkable and created a corresponding revision of Wall\n","Street sentiment. At the low level of June 1962 predictions had\n","appeared predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to\n","the end of that year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side.\n","But at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms\n","was again manifest; nearly all the forecasts were on the bullish\n","side, and they so continued through the 1964 advance.\n","We then approached the task of appraising the November 1964\n","levels of the stock market (892 for the DJIA). After discussing \n","it learnedly from numerous angles we reached three main con-\n","clusions. The first was that “old standards (of valuation) appear\n","inapplicable; new standards have not yet been tested by time.” \n","The second was that the investor “must base his policy on the \n","existence of major uncertainties. The possibilities compass the\n","extremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in\n","the market’s level—say by 50%, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on the\n","other hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the same magni-\n","tude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450\" \n","(p. 63). The third was expressed in much more definite terms. We\n","said: “Speaking bluntly, if the 1964 price level is not too high how\n","could we say that any price level is too high?” And the chapter\n","closed as follows:\n","74\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","WHAT COURSE TO FOLLOW\n","Investors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dan-\n","gerous merely because they read it in this book. They must weigh\n","our reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from\n","most competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end\n","each one must make his own decision and accept responsibility\n","therefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to\n","which course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The\n","principles of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-\n","lowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:\n","1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.\n","2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.\n","3. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring\n","it down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The\n","capital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,\n","and the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a\n","savings deposit.\n","Investors who for some time have been following a bona fide\n","dollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their\n","periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel\n","the market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather\n","strongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the\n","late 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina\n","to pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should\n","appear highly unfavorable.\n","This time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA\n","advanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a\n","low of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of\n","debacle took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines\n","running as much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback.\n","And, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture\n","appeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and\n","greater doubts. A single fact may summarize the story: The DJIA\n","closed 1970 at a level lower than six years before—the first time\n","such a thing had happened since 1944.\n","A Century of Stock-Market History\n","75\n","Such were our efforts to evaluate former stock-market levels. Is\n","there anything we and our readers can learn from them? We con-\n","sidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953\n","(but too cautiously in the latter year), “dangerous” in 1959 (at 584\n","for DJIA), and “too high” (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments\n","could be defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubt-\n","ful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in\n","favor of a consistent and controlled common-stock policy on the\n","one hand, and discouraging endeavors to “beat the market” or to\n","“pick the winners” on the other.\n","Nonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from\n","a renewed consideration of the level of the stock market—this time\n","as of late 1971—even if what we have to say will prove more inter-\n","esting than practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive.\n","There is a fine passage near the beginning of Aristotle’s Ethics that\n","goes: “It is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of\n","exactness which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is\n","equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a\n","mathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an ora-\n","tor.” The work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle\n","between that of a mathematician and of an orator.\n","At various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood\n","at the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previ-\n","ous edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to\n","use the price level and the related data for the Standard & Poor’s\n","composite index (or S & P 500), because it is more comprehensive\n","and representative of the general market than the 30-stock DJIA.\n","We shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four\n","dates of our former editions—namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,\n","1958 and 1963—plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take\n","the convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times\n","in 1971 and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3.\n","For our earnings figures we present both the last year’s showing\n","and the average of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use\n","the last twelve months’ figures; and for 1971 bond interest and\n","wholesale prices those of August 1971.\n","The 3-year price/earnings ratio for the market was lower in\n","October 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968.

The\n","reader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-\n","ings/price) to bond returns has grown worse during the entire\n","period, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,\n","by this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When\n","dividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the\n","relationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972.

Hence our view\n","of the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was\n","some 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-\n","point of conservative investment.

At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance\n","companies, and so-called legal trust funds. A generation ago their\n","investments were limited by law in many states to high-grade\n","bonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other\n","extreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman,\n","who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro-\n","vided he considers it an attractive purchase.\n","It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot\n","afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return\n","on their invested funds. From this there has developed the general\n","notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is\n","more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run.\n","Our view is different. The rate of return sought should be depen-\n","dent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will-\n","ing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes\n","to our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from\n","concern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and\n","enterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and\n","skill. In 1965 we added: “In many cases there may be less real risk\n","associated with buying a ‘bargain issue’ offering the chance of a\n","large profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about\n","41⁄2%.” This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus-\n","pected, since in subsequent years even the best long-term bonds\n","lost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in\n","interest rates.\n","88\n","The Basic Problem of Bond-Stock Allocation\n","We have already outlined in briefest form the portfolio policy of\n","the defensive investor.* He should divide his funds between high-\n","grade bonds and high-grade common stocks.\n","We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the\n","investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his\n","funds in common stocks, with a consequent inverse range of\n","between 75% and 25% in bonds. There is an implication here that\n","the standard division should be an equal one, or 50–50, between\n","the two major investment mediums. According to tradition the\n","sound reason for increasing the percentage in common stocks\n","would be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in a\n","protracted bear market. Conversely, sound procedure would call\n","for reducing the common-stock component below 50% when in \n","the judgment of the investor the market level has become danger-\n","ously high.\n","These copybook maxims have always been easy to enunciate\n","and always difficult to follow—because they go against that very\n","human nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear mar-\n","kets. It is almost a contradiction in terms to suggest as a feasible\n","policy for the average stockowner that he lighten his holdings when\n","the market advances beyond a certain point and add to them after\n","a corresponding decline. It is because the average man operates,\n","and apparently must operate, in opposite fashion that we have had\n","the great advances and collapses of the past; and—this writer\n","believes—we are likely to have them in the future.\n","If the division between investment and speculative operations\n","were as clear now as once it was, we might be able to envisage\n","investors as a shrewd, experienced group who sell out to the heed-\n","less, hapless speculators at high prices and buy back from them at\n","depressed levels. This picture may have had some verisimilitude in\n","bygone days, but it is hard to identify it with financial develop-\n","ments since 1949. There is no indication that such professional\n","operations as those of the mutual funds have been conducted in\n","this fashion. The percentage of the portfolio held in equities by the\n","General Portfolio Policy\n","89\n","* See Graham’s “Conclusion” to Chapter 2, p. 56–57.\n","two major types of funds—“balanced” and “common-stock”—has\n","changed very little from year to year. Their selling activities have\n","been largely related to endeavors to switch from less to more\n","promising holdings.\n","If, as we have long believed, the stock market has lost contact\n","with its old bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established,\n","then we can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce\n","his common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild\n","them later to the 75% maximum. We can urge that in general the\n","investor should not have more than one-half in equities unless he\n","has strong confidence in the soundness of his stock position and is\n","sure that he could view a market decline of the 1969–70 type with\n","equanimity. It is hard for us to see how such strong confidence can\n","be justified at the levels existing in early 1972. Thus we would\n","counsel against a greater than 50% apportionment to common\n","stocks at this time. But, for complementary reasons, it is almost\n","equally difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50%,\n","unless the investor is disquieted in his own mind about the current\n","market level, and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in\n","any further rise to, say, 25% of his total funds.\n","We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may\n","appear to be an oversimplified 50–50 formula. Under this plan the\n","guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal divi-\n","sion between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the mar-\n","ket level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%,\n","the balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock\n","portfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a\n","fall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use\n","of one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.\n","Yale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number\n","of years after 1937, but it was geared around a 35% “normal hold-\n","ing” in common stocks. In the early 1950s, however, Yale seems to\n","have given up its once famous formula, and in 1969 held 61% of its\n","portfolio in equities (including some convertibles). (At that time\n","the endowment funds of 71 such institutions, totaling $7.6 billion,\n","held 60.3% in common stocks.) The Yale example illustrates the\n","almost lethal effect of the great market advance upon the once pop-\n","ular formula approach to investment. Nonetheless we are convinced\n","that our 50–50 version of this approach makes good sense for the\n","90\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","defensive investor. It is extremely simple; it aims unquestionably in\n","the right direction; it gives the follower the feeling that he is at least\n","making some moves in response to market developments; most\n","important of all, it will restrain him from being drawn more and\n","more heavily into common stocks as the market rises to more and\n","more dangerous heights.\n","Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with\n","the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a\n","severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how\n","much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.\n","While our proposed 50–50 division is undoubtedly the simplest\n","“all-purpose program” devisable, it may not turn out to be the best\n","in terms of results achieved. (Of course, no approach, mechanical\n","or otherwise, can be advanced with any assurance that it will work\n","out better than another.) The much larger income return now\n","offered by good bonds than by representative stocks is a potent\n","argument for favoring the bond component. The investor’s choice\n","between 50% or a lower figure in stocks may well rest mainly on\n","his own temperament and attitude. If he can act as a cold-blooded\n","weigher of the odds, he would be likely to favor the low 25% stock\n","component at this time, with the idea of waiting until the DJIA div-\n","idend yield was, say, two-thirds of the bond yield before he would\n","establish his median 50–50 division between bonds and stocks.\n","Starting from 900 for the DJIA and dividends of $36 on the unit,\n","this would require either a fall in taxable bond yields from 71⁄2% to\n","about 5.5% without any change in the present return on leading\n","stocks, or a fall in the DJIA to as low as 660 if there is no reduction\n","in bond yields and no increase in dividends. A combination of\n","intermediate changes could produce the same “buying point.” A\n","program of that kind is not especially complicated; the hard part is\n","to adopt it and to stick to it not to mention the possibility that it\n","may turn out to have been much too conservative.\n","The Bond Component\n","The choice of issues in the bond component of the investor’s\n","portfolio will turn about two main questions: Should he buy tax-\n","able or tax-free bonds, and should he buy shorter- or longer-term\n","maturities? The tax decision should be mainly a matter of arith-\n","General Portfolio Policy\n","91\n","metic, turning on the difference in yields as compared with the\n","investor’s tax bracket. In January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturi-\n","ties was between obtaining, say, 71⁄2% on “grade Aa” corporate\n","bonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free issues. (The term “municipals” is\n","generally applied to all species of tax-exempt bonds, including\n","state obligations.) There was thus for this maturity a loss in income\n","of some 30% in passing from the corporate to the municipal field.\n","Hence if the investor was in a maximum tax bracket higher than\n","30% he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the munic-\n","ipal bonds; the opposite, if his maximum tax was less than 30%. A\n","single person starts paying a 30% rate when his income after\n","deductions passes $10,000; for a married couple the rate applies\n","when combined taxable income passes $20,000. It is evident that a\n","large proportion of individual investors would obtain a higher\n","return after taxes from good municipals than from good corporate\n","bonds.\n","The choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a\n","different question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself\n","against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a\n","lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable\n","gain in principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in\n","Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctuations.\n","For a period of many years in the past the only sensible bond\n","purchases for individuals were the U.S. savings issues. Their safety\n","was—and is—unquestioned; they gave a higher return than other\n","bond investments of first quality; they had a money-back option\n","and other privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness. In\n","our earlier editions we had an entire chapter entitled “U.S. Savings\n","Bonds: A Boon to Investors.”\n","As we shall point out, U.S. savings bonds still possess certain\n","unique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individ-\n","ual investor. For the man of modest capital—with, say, not more\n","than $10,000 to put into bonds—we think they are still the easiest\n","and the best choice. But those with larger funds may find other\n","mediums more desirable.\n","Let us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor con-\n","sideration, and discuss them briefly with respect to general\n","description, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and\n","other features.\n","92\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","1. u.s. savings bonds, series e and series h. We shall first sum-\n","marize their important provisions, and then discuss briefly the\n","numerous advantages of these unique, attractive, and exceedingly\n","convenient investments. The Series H bonds pay interest semi-\n","annually, as do other bonds. The rate is 4.29% for the first year, and\n","then a flat 5.10% for the next nine years to maturity. Interest on the\n","Series E bonds is not paid out, but accrues to the holder through\n","increase in redemption value. The bonds are sold at 75% of their\n","face value, and mature at 100% in 5 years 10 months after purchase.\n","If held to maturity the yield works out at 5%, compounded semi-\n","annually. If redeemed earlier, the yield moves up from a minimum\n","of 4.01% in the first year to an average of 5.20% in the next 45⁄6 years.\n","Interest on the bonds is subject to Federal income tax, but is\n","exempt from state income tax. However, Federal income tax on the\n","Series E bonds may be paid at the holder’s option either annually\n","as the interest accrues (through higher redemption value), or not\n","until the bond is actually disposed of.\n","Owners of Series E bonds may cash them in at any time (shortly\n","after purchase) at their current redemption value. Holders of Series\n","H bonds have similar rights to cash them in at par value (cost).\n","Series E bonds are exchangeable for Series H bonds, with certain\n","tax advantages. Bonds lost, destroyed, or stolen may be replaced\n","without cost. There are limitations on annual purchases, but liberal\n","provisions for co-ownership by family members make it possible\n","for most investors to buy as many as they can afford. Comment:\n","There is no other investment that combines (1) absolute assurance\n","of principal and interest payments, (2) the right to demand full\n","“money back” at any time, and (3) guarantee of at least a 5% inter-\n","est rate for at least ten years. Holders of the earlier issues of Series\n","E bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity, and\n","thus to continue to accumulate annual values at successively\n","higher rates. The deferral of income-tax payments over these long\n","periods has been of great dollar advantage; we calculate it has\n","increased the effective net-after-tax rate received by as much as a\n","third in typical cases. Conversely, the right to cash in the bonds at\n","cost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low\n","interest rates complete protection against the shrinkage in princi-\n","pal value that befell many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave\n","them the possibility of benefiting from the rise in interest rates by\n","General Portfolio Policy\n","93\n","switching their low-interest holdings into very-high-coupon issues\n","on an even-money basis.\n","In our view the special advantages enjoyed by owners of sav-\n","ings bonds now will more than compensate for their lower current\n","return as compared with other direct government obligations.\n","2. other united states bonds. Aprofusion of these issues exists,\n","covering a wide variety of coupon rates and maturity dates. All of\n","them are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and\n","principal. They are subject to Federal income taxes but free from\n","state income tax. In late 1971 the long-term issues—over ten years—\n","showed an average yield of 6.09%, intermediate issues (three to five\n","years) returned 6.35%, and short issues returned 6.03%.\n","In 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large dis-\n","counts. Some of these are accepted at par in settlement of estate\n","taxes. Example: The U.S. Treasury 31⁄2s due 1990 are in this category;\n","they sold at 60 in 1970, but closed 1970 above 77.\n","It is interesting to note also that in many cases the indirect obli-\n","gations of the U.S. government yield appreciably more than its\n","direct obligations of the same maturity. As we write, an offering\n","appears of 7.05% of “Certificates Fully Guaranteed by the Secretary\n","of Transportation of the Department of Transportation of the\n","United States.” The yield was fully 1% more than that on direct\n","obligations of the U.S., maturing the same year (1986). The certifi-\n","cates were actually issued in the name of the Trustees of the Penn\n","Central Transportation Co., but they were sold on the basis of a\n","statement by the U.S. Attorney General that the guarantee “brings\n","into being a general obligation of the United States, backed by its\n","full faith and credit.” Quite a number of indirect obligations of this\n","sort have been assumed by the U.S. government in the past, and all\n","of them have been scrupulously honored.\n","The reader may wonder why all this hocus-pocus, involving an\n","apparently “personal guarantee” by our Secretary of Transporta-\n","tion, and a higher cost to the taxpayer in the end. The chief reason\n","for the indirection has been the debt limit imposed on govern-\n","ment borrowing by the Congress. Apparently guarantees by the\n","government are not regarded as debts—a semantic windfall for\n","shrewder investors. Perhaps the chief impact of this situation has\n","been the creation of tax-free Housing Authority bonds, enjoying\n","94\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","the equivalent of a U.S. guarantee, and virtually the only tax-\n","exempt issues that are equivalent to government bonds. Another\n","type of government-backed issues is the recently created New\n","Community Debentures, offered to yield 7.60% in September 1971.\n","3. state and municipal bonds. These enjoy exemption from\n","Federal income tax. They are also ordinarily free of income tax in\n","the state of issue but not elsewhere. They are either direct obliga-\n","tions of a state or subdivision, or “revenue bonds” dependent for\n","interest payments on receipts from a toll road, bridge, building\n","lease, etc. Not all tax-free bonds are strongly enough protected to\n","justify their purchase by a defensive investor. He may be guided in\n","his selection by the rating given to each issue by Moody’s or Stan-\n","dard & Poor’s. One of three highest ratings by both services—Aaa\n","(AAA), Aa (AA), or A—should constitute a sufficient indication of\n","adequate safety. The yield on these bonds will vary both with the\n","quality and the maturity, with the shorter maturities giving the\n","lower return. In late 1971 the issues represented in Standard &\n","Poor’s municipal bond index averaged AA in quality rating, 20\n","years in maturity, and 5.78% in yield. A typical offering of\n","Vineland, N.J., bonds, rated AA for A and gave a yield of only 3%\n","on the one-year maturity, rising to 5.8% to the 1995 and 1996 matu-\n","rities.1\n","4. corporation bonds. These bonds are subject to both Federal\n","and state tax. In early 1972 those of highest quality yielded 7.19%\n","for a 25-year maturity, as reflected in the published yield of\n","Moody’s Aaa corporate bond index. The so-called lower-medium-\n","grade issues—rated Baa—returned 8.23% for long maturities. In\n","each class shorter-term issues would yield somewhat less than\n","longer-term obligations.\n","Comment. The above summaries indicate that the average\n","investor has several choices among high-grade bonds. Those in\n","high income-tax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield\n","from good tax-free issues than from taxable ones. For others the\n","early 1972 range of taxable yield would seem to be from 5.00% on\n","U.S. savings bonds, with their special options, to about 71⁄2% on\n","high-grade corporate issues.\n","General Portfolio Policy\n","95\n","Higher-Yielding Bond Investments\n","By sacrificing quality an investor can obtain a higher income\n","return from his bonds. Long experience has demonstrated that the\n","ordinary investor is wiser to keep away from such high-yield\n","bonds. While, taken as a whole, they may work out somewhat bet-\n","ter in terms of overall return than the first-quality issues, they\n","expose the owner to too many individual risks of untoward devel-\n","opments, ranging from disquieting price declines to actual default.\n","(It is true that bargain opportunities occur fairly often in lower-\n","grade bonds, but these require special study and skill to exploit\n","successfully.)*\n","Perhaps we should add here that the limits imposed by Con-\n","gress on direct bond issues of the United States have produced at\n","least two sorts of “bargain opportunities” for investors in the pur-\n","chase of government-backed obligations. One is provided by the\n","tax-exempt “New Housing” issues, and the other by the recently\n","created (taxable) “New Community debentures.” An offering of\n","New Housing issues in July 1971 yielded as high as 5.8%, free from\n","both Federal and state taxes, while an issue of (taxable) New Com-\n","munity debentures sold in September 1971 yielded 7.60%.

New Housing Authority bonds were backed by the U.S. Department\n","of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and were exempt from income\n","tax, but they have not been issued since 1974. New Community debentures,\n","also backed by HUD, were authorized by a Federal law passed in 1968.\n","About $350 million of these debentures were issued through 1975, but the\n","program was terminated in 1983.\n","Savings Deposits in Lieu of Bonds\n","An investor may now obtain as high an interest rate from a \n","savings deposit in a commercial or savings bank (or from a bank\n","certificate of deposit) as he can from a first-grade bond of short\n","maturity. The interest rate on bank savings accounts may be low-\n","ered in the future, but under present conditions they are a suitable\n","substitute for short-term bond investment by the individual.\n","Convertible Issues\n","These are discussed in Chapter 16. The price variability of bonds\n","in general is treated in Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctu-\n","ations.\n","Call Provisions\n","In previous editions we had a fairly long discussion of this\n","aspect of bond financing, because it involved a serious but little\n","noticed injustice to the investor. In the typical case bonds were\n","callable fairly soon after issuance, and at modest premiums—say\n","5%—above the issue price. This meant that during a period of wide\n","fluctuations in the underlying interest rates the investor had to\n","bear the full brunt of unfavorable changes and was deprived of all\n","but a meager participation in favorable ones.\n","Example: Our standard example has been the issue of American\n","Gas & Electric 100-year 5% debentures, sold to the public at 101 in\n","1928. Four years later, under near-panic conditions, the price of\n","these good bonds fell to 621⁄2, yielding 8%. By 1946, in a great rever-\n","sal, bonds of this type could be sold to yield only 3%, and the 5%\n","issue should have been quoted at close to 160. But at that point the\n","company took advantage of the call provision and redeemed the\n","issue at a mere 106.\n","The call feature in these bond contracts was a thinly disguised\n","instance of “heads I win, tails you lose.” At long last, the bond-\n","buying institutions refused to accept this unfair arrangement; in\n","recent years most long-term high-coupon issues have been pro-\n","tected against redemption for ten years or more after issuance. This\n","still limits their possible price rise, but not inequitably.\n","General Portfolio Policy\n","97\n","In practical terms, we advise the investor in long-term issues to\n","sacrifice a small amount of yield to obtain the assurance of non-\n","callability—say for 20 or 25 years. Similarly, there is an advantage\n","in buying a low-coupon bond* at a discount rather than a high-\n","coupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years. For\n","the discount—e.g., of a 31⁄2% bond at 631⁄2%, yielding 7.85%—carries\n","full protection against adverse call action.\n","Straight—i.e., Nonconvertible—Preferred Stocks\n","Certain general observations should be made here on the subject\n","of preferred stocks. Really good preferred stocks can and do exist,\n","but they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an\n","inherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent\n","for his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi-\n","dends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omit-\n","ted, or even in danger, his own position becomes precarious, for\n","the directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless\n","they also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical pre-\n","ferred stock carries no share in the company’s profits beyond the\n","fixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal\n","claim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of\n","a common shareholder (or partner).\n","These weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend\n","to come to the fore recurrently in periods of depression. Only a\n","small percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched\n","as to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis-\n","situdes. Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is\n","when their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At\n","such times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but\n","too unconventional for the defensive investor.)\n","In other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not\n","at all. We shall refer later to convertible and similarly privileged\n","issues, which carry some special possibilities of profits. These are\n","not ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio.\n","Another peculiarity in the general position of preferred stocks\n","98\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* A bond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays a rate of\n","interest income below the market average.\n","deserves mention. They have a much better tax status for corpora-\n","tion buyers than for individual investors. Corporations pay income\n","tax on only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the\n","full amount of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corpo-\n","rate rate is 48%, this means that $100 received as preferred-stock\n","dividends is taxed only $7.20, whereas $100 received as bond inter-\n","est is taxed $48. On the other hand, individual investors pay\n","exactly the same tax on preferred-stock investments as on bond\n","interest, except for a recent minor exemption. Thus, in strict logic,\n","all investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo-\n","rations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by investors\n","who pay income tax.*\n","Security Forms\n","The bond form and the preferred-stock form, as hitherto dis-\n","cussed, are well-understood and relatively simple matters. A bond-\n","holder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal\n","on a definite date. The owner of a preferred stock is entitled to a\n","fixed dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any com-\n","mon dividend. His principal value does not come due on any spec-\n","ified date. (The dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He\n","may or may not have a vote.)\n","The above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the\n","majority of bond and preferred issues, but there are innumerable\n","departures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible\n","and similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest\n","does not have to be paid unless it is earned by the company.\n","(Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn-\n","ings, but the period is often limited to three years.)\n","Income bonds should be used by corporations much more\n","General Portfolio Policy\n","99\n","* While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed. Corpora-\n","tions can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from dividends,\n","and the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a corporation would pay\n","roughly $24.50 in tax on $100 in dividends from preferred stock versus\n","$35 in tax on $100 in interest income. Individuals pay the same rate of\n","income tax on dividend income that they do on interest income, so preferred\n","stock offers them no tax advantage.\n","extensively than they are. Their avoidance apparently arises from a\n","mere accident of economic history—namely, that they were first\n","employed in quantity in connection with railroad reorganizations,\n","and hence they have been associated from the start with financial\n","weakness and poor investment status. But the form itself has sev-\n","eral practical advantages, especially in comparison with and in\n","substitution for the numerous (convertible) preferred-stock issues\n","of recent years. Chief of these is the deductibility of the interest\n","paid from the company’s taxable income, which in effect cuts the\n","cost of that form of capital in half. From the investor’s standpoint it\n","is probably best for him in most cases that he should have (1) an\n","unconditional right to receive interest payments when they are\n","earned by the company, and (2) a right to other forms of protection\n","than bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and paid. The\n","terms of income bonds can be tailored to the advantage of both \n","the borrower and the lender in the manner best suited to both.\n","(Conversion privileges can, of course, be included.) The acceptance\n","by everybody of the inherently weak preferred-stock form and \n","the rejection of the stronger income-bond form is a fascinating\n","illustration of the way in which traditional institutions and habits\n","often tend to persist on Wall Street despite new conditions calling\n","for a fresh point of view. With every new wave of optimism or \n","pessimism, we are ready to abandon history and time-tested prin-\n","ciples, but we cling tenaciously and unquestioningly to our preju-\n","dices.\n","100\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 4\n","When you leave it to chance, then all of a sudden you don’t\n","have any more luck.\n","—Basketball coach Pat Riley\n","How aggressive should your portfolio be?\n","That, says Graham, depends less on what kinds of investments you\n","own than on what kind of investor you are.

The “passive” or “defensive” strategy\n","takes little time or effort but requires an almost ascetic detachment\n","from the alluring hullabaloo of the market. As the investment thinker\n","Charles Ellis has explained, the enterprising approach is physically\n","and intellectually taxing, while the defensive approach is emotionally\n","demanding.1\n","If you have time to spare, are highly competitive, think like a sports\n","fan, and relish a complicated intellectual challenge, then the active\n","101\n","1 For more about the distinction between physically and intellectually difficult\n","investing on the one hand, and emotionally difficult investing on the other,\n","see Chapter 8 and also Charles D.

Graham’s distinction between\n","active and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial\n","risk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in our\n","investments—but also within ourselves.\n","C A N  Y O U  B E  B R A V E ,  O R  W I L L  Y O U  C A V E ?\n","How, then, should a defensive investor get started?

We have commented on the\n","converse situation that has developed in the ensuing 20 years,\n","whereby the big advance in stock prices made them appear safe\n","and profitable investments at record high levels which might actu-\n","ally carry with them a considerable degree of risk.†\n","The argument we made for common stocks in 1949 turned on\n","112\n","* At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by stocks\n","over the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term Treasury\n","bonds—meaning that $10,000 invested in stocks would have grown to\n","$18,415 over that period, while the same amount in bonds would have\n","turned into $21,494. Naturally enough, 1949 turned out to be a fabulous\n","time to buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock\n","index gained an average of 20.1% per year, one of the best long-term\n","returns in the history of the U.S. stock market.\n","† Graham’s earlier comments on this subject appear on pp. 19–20. Just\n","imagine what he would have thought about the stock market of the late\n","1990s, in which each new record-setting high was considered further\n","“proof” that stocks were the riskless way to wealth!\n","two main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable\n","degree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar\n","caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The\n","second advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average\n","return to investors over the years. This was produced both by an\n","average dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and\n","by an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the\n","years in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.\n","While these two advantages have been of major importance—\n","and have given common stocks a far better record than bonds \n","over the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these\n","benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price\n","for his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years\n","for the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it \n","had abysmally fallen in 1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stocks\n","have once again, through their high prices, lost their traditional\n","advantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains to\n","The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks\n","113\n","* The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17\n","on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until November 23,\n","1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit 382.74. (When you\n","say you intend to own stocks “for the long run,” do you realize just how long\n","the long run can be—or that many investors who bought in 1929 were no\n","longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient investors who reinvested\n","their income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,\n","simply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-\n","ing to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London\n","Business School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent\n","all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.\n","But if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have\n","been worth $16,797! Far from being an afterthought, dividends are the\n","greatest force in stock investing.\n","† Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stock’s\n","yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common\n","stock. If a company pays a $2 annual dividend when its stock price is $100\n","per share, its yield is 2%.

For\n","reasons already given* we feel that the defensive investor cannot\n","afford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks\n","in his portfolio, even if he must regard them as the lesser of two\n","evils—the greater being the risks attached to an all-bond holding.\n","Rules for the Common-Stock Component\n","The selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive\n","investor should be a relatively simple matter. Here we would sug-\n","gest four rules to be followed:\n","1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversifica-\n","tion. This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a\n","maximum of about thirty.†\n","2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and con-\n","servatively financed. Indefinite as these adjectives must be, their\n","general sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the\n","end of the chapter.\n","3. Each company should have a long record of continuous divi-\n","dend payments. (All the issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-\n","114\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","pundits declared that it could not possibly last. Never before had stocks\n","yielded less than bonds; after all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why\n","would anyone buy them at all unless they pay extra dividend income to com-\n","pensate for their greater risk? The experts argued that bonds would outyield\n","stocks for a few months at most, and then things would revert to “normal.”\n","More than four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again;\n","the yield on stocks has (so far) continuously stayed below the yield on\n","bonds.\n","* See pp. 56–57 and 88–89.\n","† For another view of diversification, see the sidebar in the commentary on\n","Chapter 14 (p. 368).\n","age met this dividend requirement in 1971.) To be specific on this\n","point we would suggest the requirement of continuous dividend\n","payments beginning at least in 1950.*\n","4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will\n","pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the\n","past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such\n","average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last\n","twelve-month period. But such a restriction would eliminate\n","nearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the port-\n","folio. In particular, it would ban virtually the entire category of\n","“growth stocks,” which have for some years past been the favorites\n","of both speculators and institutional investors. We must give our\n","reasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion.\n","Growth Stocks and the Defensive Investor\n","The term “growth stock” is applied to one which has increased\n","its per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common\n","stocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future.\n","(Some authorities would say that a true growth stock should be\n","expected at least to double its per-share earnings in ten years—i.e.,\n","to increase them at a compounded annual rate of over 7.1%.)†\n","Obviously stocks of this kind are attractive to buy and to own, pro-\n","vided the price paid is not excessive. The problem lies there, of\n","The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks\n","115\n","* Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of\n","continuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from consideration\n","only one member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average—Microsoft—and\n","would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the S & P 500\n","index). Even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would\n","not be overly restrictive; according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in\n","the S & P 500 met that standard as of year-end 2002.\n","† The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of time an\n","amount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed growth rate\n","into 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years (72 divided by \n","6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock will double its\n","earnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1 years).\n","course, since growth stocks have long sold at high prices in relation\n","to current earnings and at much higher multiples of their average\n","profits over a past period. This has introduced a speculative ele-\n","ment of considerable weight in the growth-stock picture and has\n","made successful operations in this field a far from simple matter.\n","The leading growth issue has long been International Business\n","Machines, and it has brought phenomenal rewards to those who\n","bought it years ago and held on to it tenaciously. But we have\n","already pointed out* that this “best of common stocks” actually\n","lost 50% of its market price in a six-months’ decline during 1961–62\n","and nearly the same percentage in 1969–70. Other growth stocks\n","have been even more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some\n","cases not only has the price fallen back but the earnings as well,\n","thus causing a double discomfiture to those who owned them. A\n","good second example for our purpose is Texas Instruments, which\n","in six years rose from 5 to 256, without paying a dividend, while its\n","earnings increased from 40 cents to $3.91 per share. (Note that the\n","price advanced five times as fast as the profits; this is characteristic\n","of popular common stocks.) But two years later the earnings had\n","dropped off by nearly 50% and the price by four-fifths, to 49.†\n","The reader will understand from these instances why we regard\n","growth stocks as a whole as too uncertain and risky a vehicle for\n","the defensive investor. Of course, wonders can be accomplished\n","with the right individual selections, bought at the right levels, and\n","later sold after a huge rise and before the probable decline. But the\n","average investor can no more expect to accomplish this than to find\n","money growing on trees. In contrast we think that the group of\n","116\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Graham makes this point on p. 73.\n","† To show that Graham’s observations are perennially true, we can substi-\n","tute Microsoft for IBM and Cisco for Texas Instruments. Thirty years apart,\n","the results are uncannily similar: Microsoft’s stock dropped 55.7% from\n","2000 through 2002, while Cisco’s stock—which had risen roughly 50-fold\n","over the previous six years—lost 76% of its value from 2000 through 2002.\n","As with Texas Instruments, the drop in Cisco’s stock price was sharper than\n","the fall in its earnings, which dropped just 39.2% (comparing the three-year\n","average for 1997–1999 against 2000–2002). As always, the hotter they\n","are, the harder they fall.\n","large companies that are relatively unpopular, and therefore\n","obtainable at reasonable earnings multipliers,* offers a sound if\n","unspectacular area of choice by the general public. We shall illus-\n","trate this idea in our chapter on portfolio selection.\n","Portfolio Changes\n","It is now standard practice to submit all security lists for peri-\n","odic inspection in order to see whether their quality can be\n","improved. This, of course, is a major part of the service provided\n","for clients by investment counselors. Nearly all brokerage houses\n","are ready to make corresponding suggestions, without special fee,\n","in return for the commission business involved. Some brokerage\n","houses maintain investment services on a fee basis.\n","Presumably our defensive investor should obtain—at least once\n","a year—the same kind of advice regarding changes in his portfolio\n","as he sought when his funds were first committed. Since he will\n","have little expertness of his own on which to rely, it is essential that\n","he entrust himself only to firms of the highest reputation; other-\n","wise he may easily fall into incompetent or unscrupulous hands. It\n","is important, in any case, that at every such consultation he make\n","clear to his adviser that he wishes to adhere closely to the four\n","rules of common-stock selection given earlier in this chapter. Inci-\n","dentally, if his list has been competently selected in the first\n","instance, there should be no need for frequent or numerous\n","changes.†\n","The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks\n","117\n","* “Earnings multiplier” is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings ratios, which\n","measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared to the\n","profitability of the underlying business.

Graham would, however, warn against relying exclu-\n","sively on such a system; you must use your own judgment to supplement\n","the software.\n","Dollar-Cost Averaging\n","The New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into\n","popularizing its “monthly purchase plan,” under which an\n","investor devotes the same dollar amount each month to buying\n","one or more common stocks. This is an application of a special type\n","of “formula investment” known as dollar-cost averaging. During\n","the predominantly rising-market experience since 1949 the results\n","from such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory, espe-\n","cially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his\n","buying at the wrong times.\n","In Lucile Tomlinson’s comprehensive study of formula invest-\n","ment plans,1 the author presented a calculation of the results of \n","dollar-cost averaging in the group of stocks making up the Dow\n","Jones industrial index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year pur-\n","chase periods, the first ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test\n","showed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within\n","five years thereafter. The average indicated profit at the end of the\n","23 buying periods was 21.5%, exclusive of dividends received.\n","Needless to say, in some instances there was a substantial tempo-\n","rary depreciation at market value. Miss Tomlinson ends her discus-\n","sion of this ultrasimple investment formula with the striking\n","sentence: “No one has yet discovered any other formula for invest-\n","ing which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate suc-\n","cess, regardless of what may happen to security prices, as Dollar\n","Cost Averaging.”\n","It may be objected that dollar-cost averaging, while sound in\n","principle, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so\n","situated that they can have available for common-stock investment\n","the same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to\n","me that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent\n","years. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces-\n","sary component of a sound savings-investment program. Thus,\n","systematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present\n","no more psychological and financial difficulties than similar con-\n","tinuous payments for United States savings bonds and for life\n","insurance—to which they should be complementary. The monthly\n","amount may be small, but the results after 20 or more years can be\n","impressive and important to the saver.\n","118\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","The Investor’s Personal Situation\n","At the beginning of this chapter we referred briefly to the posi-\n","tion of the individual portfolio owner. Let us return to this matter,\n","in the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To what\n","extent should the type of securities selected by the investor vary\n","with his circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely\n","different conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left $200,000 with\n","which to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in\n","mid-career, with savings of $100,000 and yearly accretions of\n","$10,000; and (3) a young man earning $200 per week and saving\n","$1,000 a year.*\n","For the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif-\n","ficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in her\n","investments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally\n","between United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a\n","compromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-\n","eral prescription for the defensive investor. (The stock component\n","may be placed as high as 75% if the investor is psychologically pre-\n","pared for this decision, and if she can be almost certain she is not\n","buying at too high a level. Assuredly this is not the case in early\n","1972.)\n","We do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify\n","as an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth-\n","ods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must not do is\n","to take speculative chances in order to “make some extra income.”\n","By this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-\n","essary equipment to warrant full confidence in overall success. It\n","would be far better for her to draw $2,000 per year out of her prin-\n","cipal, in order to make both ends meet, than to risk half of it in\n","poorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.\n","The prosperous doctor has none of the widow’s pressures and\n","compulsions, yet we believe that his choices are pretty much the\n","same. Is he willing to take a serious interest in the business of\n","investment? If he lacks the impulse or the flair, he will do best to\n","The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks\n","119\n","* To update Graham’s figures, take each dollar amount in this section and\n","multiply it by five.\n","accept the easy role of the defensive investor. The division of his\n","portfolio should then be no different from that of the “typical”\n","widow, and there would be the same area of personal choice in fix-\n","ing the size of the stock component. The annual savings should be\n","invested in about the same proportions as the total fund.\n","The average doctor may be more likely than the average widow\n","to elect to become an enterprising investor, and he is perhaps more\n","likely to succeed in the undertaking. He has one important handi-\n","cap, however—the fact that he has less time available to give to his\n","investment education and to the administration of his funds. In\n","fact, medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu-\n","rity dealings. The reason for this is that they usually have an ample\n","confidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a\n","good return on their money, without the realization that to do so\n","successfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and\n","something of a professional approach to security values.\n","Finally, the young man who saves $1,000 a year—and expects to\n","do better gradually—finds himself with the same choices, though\n","for still different reasons. Some of his savings should go automati-\n","cally into Series E bonds. The balance is so modest that it seems\n","hardly worthwhile for him to undergo a tough educational and\n","temperamental discipline in order to qualify as an aggressive\n","investor. Thus a simple resort to our standard program for the\n","defensive investor would be at once the easiest and the most logi-\n","cal policy.\n","Let us not ignore human nature at this point. Finance has a fasci-\n","nation for many bright young people with limited means. They\n","would like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the placement\n","of their savings, even though investment income is much less\n","important to them than their salaries. This attitude is all to the\n","good. There is a great advantage for the young capitalist to begin\n","his financial education and experience early. If he is going to oper-\n","ate as an aggressive investor he is certain to make some mistakes\n","and to take some losses. Youth can stand these disappointments\n","and profit by them. We urge the beginner in security buying not to\n","waste his efforts and his money in trying to beat the market. Let\n","him study security values and initially test out his judgment on\n","price versus value with the smallest possible sums.\n","Thus we return to the statement, made at the outset, that the\n","120\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","kind of securities to be purchased and the rate of return to be\n","sought depend not on the investor’s financial resources but on his\n","financial equipment in terms of knowledge, experience, and tem-\n","perament.\n","Note on the Concept of “Risk”\n","It is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good\n","preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common\n","stocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-\n","mon stocks because they are not “safe,” which was demonstrated\n","in the Federal Reserve Board’s survey of 1948. We should like to\n","point out that the words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securi-\n","ties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.\n","A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or\n","principal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-\n","mon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-\n","dend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the\n","dividend means that it has proved unsafe. It is also true that an\n","investment contains a risk if there is a fair possibility that the\n","holder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.\n","Nevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos-\n","sible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may\n","be of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder\n","is unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres-\n","ent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to\n","a greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior\n","issues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a\n","true risk in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds a\n","mortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he\n","were forced to sell it at an unfavorable time. That element is not\n","taken into account in judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-\n","estate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual\n","payments. In the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com-\n","mercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money, not\n","by what would happen if the owner were forced to sell.\n","In Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide\n","investor does not lose money merely because the market price of\n","his holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does\n","The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks\n","121\n","not mean that he is running a true risk of loss. If a group of well-\n","selected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall\n","return, as measured through a fair number of years, then this\n","group investment has proved to be “safe.” During that period its\n","market value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell\n","for a while under the buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment\n","“risky,” it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the\n","same time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept\n","of risk solely to a loss of value which either is realized through\n","actual sale, or is caused by a significant deterioration in the\n","company’s position—or, more frequently perhaps, is the result of\n","the payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth\n","of the security.2\n","Many common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration. But\n","it is our thesis that a properly executed group investment in com-\n","mon stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that\n","therefore it should not be termed “risky” merely because of the ele-\n","ment of price fluctuation.

An\n","industrial company’s finances are not conservative unless the com-\n","mon stock (at book value) represents at least half of the total capi-\n","talization, including all bank debt.3 For a railroad or public utility\n","the figure should be at least 30%.\n","The words “large” and “prominent” carry the notion of substan-\n","tial size combined with a leading position in the industry.

As an old Turkish proverb says,\n","“After you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.”\n","Because the crash of 2000–2002 was so terrible, many investors\n","now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of\n","crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot\n","milk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.\n","Viewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has\n","nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning\n","them a few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to\n","give you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the\n","losses they may have cost you in the recent past.

Meanwhile, at recent prices,\n","bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their\n","supposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himself\n","against lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular\n","investing slogans was “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch—who from\n","1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track record\n","ever compiled by a mutual fund—was the most charismatic preacher of\n","this gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage\n","that professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power of\n","common knowledge.” If you discover a great new restaurant, car,\n","toothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby\n","business is always full or that people are still working at a company’s\n","headquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-\n","sonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-\n","ager might never pick up on. As Lynch put it, “During a lifetime of\n","buying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what’s good and\n","what’s bad, what sells and what doesn’t . . . and the most important\n","part is, you know it before Wall Street knows it.” 1\n","Lynch’s rule—“You can outperform the experts if you use your edge\n","by investing in companies or industries you already understand”—isn’t\n","Commentary on Chapter 5\n","125\n","1 Peter Lynch with John Rothchild, One Up on Wall Street (Penguin, 1989),\n","p. 23.\n","totally implausible, and thousands of investors have profited from it\n","over the years. But Lynch’s rule can work only if you follow its corollary\n","as well: “Finding the promising company is only the first step. The next\n","step is doing the research.” To his credit, Lynch insists that no one\n","should ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or\n","how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements\n","and estimating its business value.\n","Unfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.\n","Barbra Streisand, the day-trading diva, personified the way people\n","abuse Lynch’s teachings. In 1999 she burbled, “We go to Starbucks\n","every day, so I buy Starbucks stock.” But the Funny Girl forgot that no\n","matter how much you love those tall skinny lattes, you still have to ana-\n","lyze Starbucks’s financial statements and make sure the stock isn’t\n","even more overpriced than the coffee. Countless stock buyers made\n","the same mistake by loading up on shares of Amazon.com because\n","they loved the website or buying e*Trade stock because it was their\n","own online broker.\n","“Experts” gave the idea credence too. In an interview televised on\n","CNN in late 1999, portfolio manager Kevin Landis of the Firsthand\n","Funds was asked plaintively, “How do you do it? Why can’t I do it,\n","Kevin?” (From 1995 through the end of 1999, the Firsthand Technol-\n","ogy Value fund produced an astounding 58.2% average annualized\n","gain.) “Well, you can do it,” Landis chirped. “All you really need to do is\n","focus on the things that you know, and stay close to an industry, and\n","talk to people who work in it every day.” 2\n","The most painful perversion of Lynch’s rule occurred in corporate\n","retirement plans.

In fact\n","corporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it vir-\n","tually impossible to sell “straight bonds”—i.e., nonconvertibles—\n","to the public in the past two years. Hence their debt financing has\n","been done by the sale of convertible bonds (or bonds with warrants\n","attached), which place them in a separate category. It follows that\n","virtually all the nonconvertible bonds of inferior rating represent\n","older issues which are selling at a large discount.

Example: In early 1964\n","Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific 5% income debenture\n","bonds, at 68, yielded 7.35%. But the total interest charges of the\n","road, before income taxes, were earned only 1.5 times in 1963,\n","against our requirement of 5 times for a well-protected railroad\n","issue.1\n","Many investors buy securities of this kind because they “need\n","income” and cannot get along with the meager return offered by\n","top-grade issues. Experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy\n","a bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety merely because\n","the yield is attractive.* (Here the word “merely” implies that the\n","issue is not selling at a large discount and thus does not offer an\n","opportunity for a substantial gain in principal value.) Where such\n","securities are bought at full prices—that is, not many points under\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach\n","135\n","* For a recent example that painfully reinforces Graham’s point, see p. 146\n","below.\n","100*—the chances are very great that at some future time the\n","holder will see much lower quotations. For when bad business\n","comes, or just a bad market, issues of this kind prove highly sus-\n","ceptible to severe sinking spells; often interest or dividends are \n","suspended or at least endangered, and frequently there is a pro-\n","nounced price weakness even though the operating results are not\n","at all bad.\n","As a specific illustration of this characteristic of second-quality\n","senior issues, let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten\n","railroad income bonds in 1946–47. These comprise all of those which\n","sold at 96 or more in 1946, their high prices averaging 1021⁄2. By the\n","following year the group had registered low prices averaging only\n","68, a loss of one-third of the market value in a very short time.\n","Peculiarly enough, the railroads of the country were showing\n","much better earnings in 1947 than in 1946; hence the drastic price\n","decline ran counter to the business picture and was a reflection of\n","the selloff in the general market. But it should be pointed out that\n","the shrinkage in these income bonds was proportionately larger\n","than that in the common stocks in the Dow Jones industrial list\n","(about 23%). Obviously the purchaser of these bonds at a cost\n","above 100 could not have expected to participate to any extent in a\n","further rise in the securities market. The only attractive feature was\n","the income yield, averaging about 4.25% (against 2.50% for first-\n","grade bonds, an advantage of 1.75% in annual income). Yet the\n","sequel showed all too soon and too plainly that for the minor\n","advantage in annual income the buyer of these second-grade\n","bonds was risking the loss of a substantial part of his principal.\n","The above example permits us to pay our respects to the popu-\n","lar fallacy that goes under the sobriquet of a “businessman’s\n","investment.” That involves the purchase of a security showing a\n","larger yield than is obtainable on a high-grade issue and carrying \n","a correspondingly greater risk. It is bad business to accept an\n","136\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Bond prices are quoted in percentages of “par value,” or 100. A bond\n","priced at “85” is selling at 85% of its principal value; a bond originally\n","offered for $10,000, but now selling at 85, will cost $8,500.

If you are willing to\n","assume some risk you should be certain that you can realize a\n","really substantial gain in principal value if things go well. Hence a\n","second-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is almost always a bad\n","purchase. The same issue at 70 might make more sense—and if you\n","are patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level.\n","Second-grade bonds and preferred stocks possess two contra-\n","dictory attributes which the intelligent investor must bear clearly\n","in mind. Nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets. On\n","the other hand, a large proportion recover their position when\n","favorable conditions return, and these ultimately “work out all\n","right.” This is true even of (cumulative) preferred stocks that fail to\n","pay dividends for many years. There were a number of such issues\n","in the early 1940s, as a consequence of the long depression of the\n","1930s. During the postwar boom period of 1945–1947 many of\n","these large accumulations were paid off either in cash or in new\n","securities, and the principal was often discharged as well. As a\n","result, large profits were made by people who, a few years previ-\n","ously, had bought these issues when they were friendless and sold\n","at low prices.2\n","It may well be true that, in an overall accounting, the higher\n","yields obtainable on second-grade senior issues will prove to have\n","offset those principal losses that were irrecoverable. In other\n","words, an investor who bought all such issues at their offering\n","prices might conceivably fare as well, in the long run, as one who\n","limited himself to first-quality securities; or even somewhat better.3\n","But for practical purposes the question is largely irrelevant.\n","Regardless of the outcome, the buyer of second-grade issues at full\n","prices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines\n","precipitately. Furthermore, he cannot buy enough issues to assure\n","an “average” result, nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of\n","his larger income to offset or “amortize” those principal losses\n","which prove to be permanent. Finally, it is mere common sense to\n","abstain from buying securities at around 100 if long experience\n","indicates that they can probably be bought at 70 or less in the next\n","weak market.\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach\n","137\n","Foreign Government Bonds\n","All investors with even small experience know that foreign\n","bonds, as a whole, have had a bad investment history since 1914.\n","This was inevitable in the light of two world wars and an interven-\n","ing world depression of unexampled depth.

Certainly there will be exceptions to any\n","suggested rule. Our one recommendation is that all investors\n","should be wary of new issues—which means, simply, that these\n","should be subjected to careful examination and unusually severe\n","tests before they are purchased.\n","There are two reasons for this double caveat. The first is that\n","new issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls\n","therefore for a special degree of sales resistance.* The second is that\n","most new issues are sold under “favorable market conditions”—\n","which means favorable for the seller and consequently less favor-\n","able for the buyer.†\n","The effect of these considerations becomes steadily more impor-\n","tant as we go down the scale from the highest-quality bonds\n","through second-grade senior issues to common-stock flotations at\n","the bottom. A tremendous amount of financing, consisting of the\n","repayment of existing bonds at call price and their replacement by\n","new issues with lower coupons, was done in the past. Most of this\n","was in the category of high-grade bonds and preferred stocks. The\n","buyers were largely financial institutions, amply qualified to pro-\n","tect their interests. Hence these offerings were carefully priced to\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach\n","139\n","* New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or IPOs—normally are\n","sold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in commission) of 7%.

As interest rates fell\n","lower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a price for\n","these issues, and many of them later declined appreciably in the\n","market. This is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new secu-\n","rities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the issuer;\n","but in the case of first-quality issues the ill effects to the purchaser\n","are likely to be unpleasant rather than serious.\n","The situation proves somewhat different when we study the\n","lower-grade bonds and preferred stocks sold during the 1945–46\n","and 1960–61 periods. Here the effect of the selling effort is more\n","apparent, because most of these issues were probably placed with\n","individual and inexpert investors. It was characteristic of these\n","offerings that they did not make an adequate showing when\n","judged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num-\n","ber of years. They did look safe enough, for the most part, if it\n","could be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without\n","a serious setback. The investment bankers who brought out these\n","issues presumably accepted this assumption, and their salesmen\n","had little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers\n","to a like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest-\n","ment, and one likely to prove costly.\n","Bull-market periods are usually characterized by the transfor-\n","mation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com-\n","panies with quoted shares. This was the case in 1945–46 and again\n","beginning in 1960. The process then reached extraordinary propor-\n","tions until brought to a catastrophic close in May 1962.

In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that\n","only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.\n","That undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market of the 1980s, when\n","roughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market—helping to trigger the over-\n","New Common-Stock Offerings\n","The following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the\n","1959 edition, with comment added:\n","Common-stock financing takes two different forms. In the case\n","of companies already listed, additional shares are offered pro rata\n","to the existing stockholders. The subscription price is set below \n","the current market, and the “rights” to subscribe have an initial\n","money value.* The sale of the new shares is almost always under-\n","written by one or more investment banking houses, but it is the\n","general hope and expectation that all the new shares will be taken\n","by the exercise of the subscription rights. Thus the sale of addi-\n","tional common stock of listed companies does not ordinarily call\n","for active selling effort on the part of distributing firms.\n","The second type is the placement with the public of common\n","stock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises. Most of\n","this stock is sold for the account of the controlling interests to\n","enable them to cash in on a favorable market and to diversify their\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach\n","141\n","enthusiasm that led to the 1987 crash. Then the cycle swung the other way\n","again as IPOs dried up in 1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull\n","market of the 1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the busi-\n","ness of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the\n","bubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual\n","total since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs, has\n","stayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for another scald-\n","ing. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through\n","this manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great IPO boom, back in 1825,\n","a man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu-\n","lators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark; the wealthiest buy-\n","ers hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by\n","1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.\n","* Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors who already\n","own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same\n","proportional interest in the company. This form of financing, still widespread\n","in Europe, has become rare in the United States, except among closed-end\n","funds.\n","own finances. (When new money is raised for the business it\n","comes often via the sale of preferred stock, as previously noted.)\n","This activity follows a well-defined pattern, which by the nature of\n","the security markets must bring many losses and disappointments\n","to the public. The dangers arise both from the character of the\n","businesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions\n","that make the financing possible.\n","In the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading\n","companies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the\n","number of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held\n","steadily diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have\n","tended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con-\n","cerns. By an unfortunate correlation, during the same period the\n","stock-buying public has been developing an ingrained preference\n","for the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor\n","ones. This prejudice, like many others, tends to become weaker as\n","bull markets are built up; the large and quick profits shown by\n","common stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the public’s critical\n","faculty, just as they sharpen its acquisitive instinct. During these\n","periods, also, quite a number of privately owned concerns can be\n","found that are enjoying excellent results—although most of these\n","would not present too impressive a record if the figures were car-\n","ried back, say, ten years or more.\n","When these factors are put together the following consequences\n","emerge: Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first \n","common-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced\n","not unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of\n","the early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing\n","grows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily\n","poorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One\n","fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the\n","fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies\n","are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for\n","many medium-sized companies with a long market history. (It\n","should be added that very little of this common-stock financing is\n","ordinarily done by banking houses of prime size and reputation.)*\n","142\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In Graham’s day, the most prestigious investment banks generally steered\n","clear of the IPO business, which was regarded as an undignified exploita-\n","The heedlessness of the public and the willingness of selling\n","organizations to sell whatever may be profitably sold can have\n","only one result—price collapse.

Many of these issues fall, proportionately, as\n","much below their true value as they formerly sold above it.\n","An elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an abil-\n","ity to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-\n","stock issues during bull markets. Even if one or two can be found\n","that can pass severe tests of quality and value, it is probably bad pol-\n","icy to get mixed up in this sort of business.

For every dollar you make in this way you will be lucky\n","if you end up by losing only two.\n","Some of these issues may prove excellent buys—a few years\n","later, when nobody wants them and they can be had at a small\n","fraction of their true worth.\n","In the 1965 edition we continued our discussion of this subject\n","as follows:\n","While the broader aspects of the stock market’s behavior since\n","1949 have not lent themselves well to analysis based on long expe-\n","rience, the development of new common-stock flotations pro-\n","ceeded exactly in accordance with ancient prescription.

But if the company reorganizes successfully and\n","comes out of bankruptcy, the bondholders often receive stock in the new\n","firm, and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is able\n","to pay interest again. Thus the bonds of a troubled company can perform\n","almost as well as the common stock of a healthy company.

That is too short a period to furnish any\n","reliable guide to the future.*\n","Growth-Stock Approach\n","Every investor would like to select the stocks of companies that\n","will do better than the average over a period of years. A growth\n","stock may be defined as one that has done this in the past and \n","is expected to do so in the future.2 Thus it seems only logical that\n","the intelligent investor should concentrate upon the selection of\n","growth stocks. Actually the matter is more complicated, as we shall\n","try to show.\n","It is a mere statistical chore to identify companies that have “out-\n","performed the averages” in the past. The investor can obtain a list of\n","50 or 100 such enterprises from his broker.† Why, then, should he\n","not merely pick out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of this\n","group and lo! he has a guaranteed-successful stock portfolio?\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","157\n","* Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972, he con-\n","tends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22 years—is too\n","short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his mastery of\n","mathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions require very\n","long samples of large amounts of data. The charlatans who peddle “time-\n","tested” stock-picking gimmicks almost always base their findings on smaller\n","samples than Graham would ever accept.

The first is that com-\n","mon stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell\n","at correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his\n","judgment of their prospects and still not fare particularly well,\n","merely because he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the\n","expected prosperity. The second is that his judgment as to the\n","future may prove wrong. Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up\n","forever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expan-\n","sion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement\n","more difficult. At some point the growth curve flattens out, and in\n","many cases it turns downward.\n","It is obvious that if one confines himself to a few chosen\n","instances, based on hindsight, he could demonstrate that fortunes\n","can readily be either made or lost in the growth-stock field. How\n","can one judge fairly of the overall results obtainable here? We think\n","that reasonably sound conclusions can be drawn from a study of\n","the results achieved by the investment funds specializing in the\n","growth-stock approach. The authoritative manual entitled Invest-\n","ment Companies, published annually by Arthur Wiesenberger &\n","Company, members of the New York Stock Exchange, computes\n","the annual performance of some 120 such “growth funds” over a\n","period of years. Of these, 45 have records covering ten years or\n","more. The average overall gain for these companies—unweighted\n","for size of fund—works out at 108% for the decade 1961–1970,\n","compared with 105% for the S & P composite and 83% for the\n","DJIA.3 In the two years 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126\n","“growth funds” did worse than either index. Similar results were\n","found in our earlier studies. The implication here is that no out-\n","standing rewards came from diversified investment in growth\n","companies as compared with that in common stocks generally.*\n","158\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in large\n","growth companies—today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “growth\n","funds”—earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall\n","stock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year. However,\n","“large value” funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies also\n","underperformed the market over the same period (by a full percentage point\n","per year). Is the problem merely that growth funds cannot reliably select\n","There is no reason at all for thinking that the average intelligent\n","investor, even with much devoted effort, can derive better results\n","over the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the invest-\n","ment companies specializing in this area. Surely these organiza-\n","tions have more brains and better research facilities at their\n","disposal than you do. Consequently we should advise against the\n","usual type of growth-stock commitment for the enterprising\n","investor.* This is one in which the excellent prospects are fully rec-\n","ognized in the market and already reflected in a current price-\n","earnings ratio of, say, higher than 20. (For the defensive investor\n","we suggested an upper limit of purchase price at 25 times average\n","earnings of the past seven years. The two criteria would be about\n","equivalent in most cases.)†\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","159\n","stocks that will outperform the market in the future? Or is it that the high\n","costs of running the average fund (whether it buys growth or “value” compa-\n","nies) exceed any extra return the managers can earn with their stock picks?\n","To update fund performance by type, see www.morningstar.com, “Category\n","Returns.” For an enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of\n","different investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_\n","table/pertable.pdf.\n","* Graham makes this point to remind you that an “enterprising” investor is\n","not one who takes more risk than average or who buys “aggressive growth”\n","stocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who is willing to put in extra\n","time and effort in researching his or her portfolio.\n","† Notice that Graham insists on calculating the price/earnings ratio based\n","on a multiyear average of past earnings. That way, you lower the odds that\n","you will overestimate a company’s value based on a temporarily high burst\n","of profitability. Imagine that a company earned $3 per share over the past\n","12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over the previous six\n","years. Which number—the sudden $3 or the steady 50 cents—is more likely\n","to represent a sustainable trend? At 25 times the $3 it earned in the most\n","recent year, the stock would be priced at $75. But at 25 times the average\n","earnings of the past seven years ($6 in total earnings, divided by seven,\n","equals 85.7 cents per share in average annual earnings), the stock would\n","be priced at only $21.43.

This is true of the\n","largest and longest-established companies—such as General Elec-\n","tric and International Business Machines—and even more so of\n","newer and smaller successful companies. They illustrate our thesis\n","that the main characteristic of the stock market since 1949 has been\n","the injection of a highly speculative element into the shares of com-\n","panies which have scored the most brilliant successes, and which\n","themselves would be entitled to a high investment rating. (Their\n","credit standing is of the best, and they pay the lowest interest rates\n","on their borrowings.) The investment caliber of such a company\n","may not change over a long span of years, but the risk characteris-\n","tics of its stock will depend on what happens to it in the stock mar-\n","ket. The more enthusiastic the public grows about it, and the faster\n","its advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the\n","riskier a proposition it becomes.*\n","But is it not true, the reader may ask, that the really big fortunes\n","from common stocks have been garnered by those who made a\n","substantial commitment in the early years of a company in whose\n","future they had great confidence, and who held their original\n","shares unwaveringly while they increased 100-fold or more in\n","value?

As for outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the\n","company, the same objection applies.\n","The Relatively Unpopular Large Company\n","If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue com-\n","mon stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are\n","glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will\n","undervalue—relatively, at least—companies that are out of favor\n","because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.\n","This may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market,\n","and it suggests an investment approach that should prove both\n","conservative and promising.\n","The key requirement here is that the enterprising investor \n","concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a\n","period of unpopularity. While small companies may also be \n","undervalued for similar reasons, and in many cases may later\n","increase their earnings and share price, they entail the risk of a\n","definitive loss of profitability and also of protracted neglect by \n","the market in spite of better earnings. The large companies thus\n","have a double advantage over the others. First, they have the\n","resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver-\n","sity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is\n","likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement\n","shown.\n","A remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is\n","found in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in\n","the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an\n","investment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues \n","in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their\n","current or previous year’s earnings. These could be called the\n","“cheapest” stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently the\n","reflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was\n","assumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of\n","holding periods ranging from one to five years. The results of these\n","investments were then compared with the results shown in either\n","the DJIA as a whole or in the highest multiplier (i.e., the most pop-\n","ular) group.\n","The detailed material we have available covers the results of\n","annual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.5 In the early\n","period, 1917–1933, this approach proved unprofitable. But since\n","1933 the method has shown highly successful results. In 34 tests\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","163\n","made by Drexel & Company (now Drexel Firestone)* of one-year\n","holding—from 1937 through 1969—the cheap stocks did definitely\n","worse than the DJIA in only three instances; the results were about\n","the same in six cases; and the cheap stocks clearly outperformed\n","the average in 25 years. The consistently better performance of the\n","low-multiplier stocks is shown (Table 7-2) by the average results\n","for successive five-year periods, when compared with those of the\n","DJIA and of the ten high-multipliers.\n","The Drexel computation shows further that an original invest-\n","ment of $10,000 made in the low-multiplier issues in 1936, and\n","switched each year in accordance with the principle, would have\n","grown to $66,900 by 1962. The same operations in high-multiplier\n","stocks would have ended with a value of only $25,300; while an\n","operation in all thirty stocks would have increased the original\n","fund to $44,000.†\n","The concept of buying “unpopular large companies” and its\n","164\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","TABLE 7-2\n","Average Annual Percentage Gain or Loss on Test\n","Issues, 1937–1969\n","10 Low-\n","10 High-\n","Multiplier\n","Multiplier\n","30 DJIA\n","Period\n","Issues\n","Issues\n","Stocks\n","1937–1942\n","– 2.2\n","–10.0\n","– 6.3\n","1943–1947\n","17.3\n","8.3\n","14.9\n","1948–1952\n","16.4\n","4.6\n","9.9\n","1953–1957\n","20.9\n","10.0\n","13.7\n","1958–1962\n","10.2\n","– 3.3\n","3.6\n","1963–1969 (8 years)\n","8.0\n","4.6\n","4.0\n","* Drexel Firestone, a Philadelphia investment bank, merged in 1973 with\n","Burnham & Co. and later became Drexel Burnham Lambert, famous for its\n","junk-bond financing of the 1980s takeover boom.\n","† This strategy of buying the cheapest stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial\n","Average is now nicknamed the “Dogs of the Dow” approach.

The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks\n","selling well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete\n","as possible, let us suggest that an issue is not a true “bargain”\n","unless the indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What\n","kind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep-\n","ancy exists? How do bargains come into existence, and how does\n","the investor profit from them?\n","There are two tests by which a bargain common stock is\n","detected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely\n","on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac-\n","tor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi-\n","ciently above the market price—and if the investor has confidence\n","in the technique employed—he can tag the stock as a bargain. The\n","second test is the value of the business to a private owner. This\n","value also is often determined chiefly by expected future earn-\n","ings—in which case the result may be identical with the first. But in\n","the second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable\n","value of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current\n","assets or working capital.\n","At low points in the general market a large proportion of com-\n","mon stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A\n","typical example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in\n","1941, equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning\n","in excess of $4 and paying $3.50, or more, in dividends.) It is true\n","that current earnings and the immediate prospects may both be\n","poor, but a levelheaded appraisal of average future conditions\n","166\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","would indicate values far above ruling prices. Thus the wisdom of\n","having courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the\n","voice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques\n","of value analysis.\n","The same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish\n","a bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of\n","many individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market is\n","fond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-\n","nary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest\n","or enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.\n","Thus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-\n","tion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect\n","or unpopularity.\n","However, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone,\n","can be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.\n","How can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are\n","indeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent\n","examples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous \n","for their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire \n","them at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in\n","boom years at a fine profit. A spectacular example is supplied by\n","Chrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.\n","If this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating\n","earnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy\n","matter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","167\n","* Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of molehills: \n","In May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n","announced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence drug Viagra had died\n","of heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock immediately went flaccid,\n","losing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading. But Pfizer’s shares surged\n","ahead when research later showed that there was no cause for alarm; the\n","stock gained roughly a third over the next two years. In late 1997, shares of\n","Warner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a day when sales of its new diabetes\n","drug were temporarily halted in England; within six months, the stock had\n","nearly doubled. In late 2002, Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships,\n","lost roughly 10% of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea\n","and vomiting—on ships run by other companies.\n","earnings and price which were not followed automatically by a\n","handsome recovery of both. One such was Anaconda Wire and\n","Cable, which had large earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85\n","in that year. The earnings then declined irregularly for six years;\n","the price fell to 231⁄2 in 1962, and the following year it was taken\n","over by its parent enterprise (Anaconda Corporation) at the equiv-\n","alent of only 33.\n","The many experiences of this type suggest that the investor\n","would need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price\n","to give him a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indi-\n","cation of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past\n","decade or more—i.e., no year of earnings deficit—plus sufficient\n","size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future.\n","The ideal combination here is thus that of a large and prominent\n","company selling both well below its past average price and its past\n","average price/earnings multiplier. This would no doubt have\n","ruled out most of the profitable opportunities in companies such as\n","Chrysler, since their low-price years are generally accompanied by\n","high price/earnings ratios. But let us assure the reader now—and\n","no doubt we shall do it again—that there is a world of difference\n","between “hindsight profits” and “real-money profits.” We doubt\n","seriously whether the Chrysler type of roller coaster is a suitable\n","medium for operations by our enterprising investor.\n","We have mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a sec-\n","ond cause of price declines to unduly low levels. A current case of\n","this kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull\n","market of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the\n","$5.61 earnings for that year. The per-share profits increased in both\n","1969 and 1970, but the price declined to only 21 in 1970. This was\n","less than 4 times the (record) earnings in that year and less than its\n","net-current-asset value. In March 1972 it was selling at 34, still only\n","51⁄2 times the last reported earnings, and at about its enlarged net-\n","current-asset value.\n","Another example of this type is provided currently by Standard\n","Oil of California, a concern of major importance. In early 1972 it\n","was selling at about the same price as 13 years before, say 56. Its\n","earnings had been remarkably steady, with relatively small growth\n","but with only one small decline over the entire period. Its book\n","value was about equal to the market price. With this conservatively\n","168\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","favorable 1958–71 record the company has never shown an aver-\n","age annual price as high as 15 times its current earnings. In early\n","1972 the price/earnings ratio was only about 10.\n","A third cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may\n","be the market’s failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our\n","classic example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 1946–47\n","declined from 36 to 131⁄2. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were\n","close to $10 per share. The price of the stock was held down in\n","great part by its $1 dividend. It was neglected also because much of\n","its earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar\n","to railroads.\n","The type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a\n","common stock that sells for less than the company’s net working\n","capital alone, after deducting all prior obligations.* This would\n","mean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets—\n","buildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist.\n","Very few companies turn out to have an ultimate value less than\n","the working capital alone, although scattered instances may be\n","found. The surprising thing, rather, is that there have been so many\n","enterprises obtainable which have been valued in the market on\n","this bargain basis. A compilation made in 1957, when the market’s\n","level was by no means low, disclosed about 150 of such common\n","stocks. In Table 7-4 we summarize the result of buying, on Decem-\n","ber 31, 1957, one share of each of the 85 companies in that list for\n","which data appeared in Standard & Poor’s Monthly Stock Guide,\n","and holding them for two years.\n","By something of a coincidence, each of the groups advanced in\n","the two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate\n","net-current-asset value. The gain for the entire “portfolio” in that\n","period was 75%, against 50% for Standard & Poor’s 425 industrials.\n","What is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed signifi-\n","cant losses, seven held about even, and 78 showed appreciable\n","gains.\n","Our experience with this type of investment selection—on a\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","169\n","* By “net working capital,” Graham means a company’s current assets (such\n","as cash, marketable securities, and inventories) minus its total liabilities\n","(including preferred stock and long-term debt).\n","diversified basis—was uniformly good for many years prior to\n","1957. It can probably be affirmed without hesitation that it consti-\n","tutes a safe and profitable method of determining and taking\n","advantage of undervalued situations.

This has meant that the latter group have usually sold\n","at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have\n","the former. It has meant further that in many instances the price\n","has fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class.\n","When investors rejected the stocks of secondary companies,\n","even though these sold at relatively low prices, they were express-\n","ing a belief or fear that such companies faced a dismal future. In\n","fact, at least subconsciously, they calculated that any price was too\n","high for them because they were heading for extinction—just as in\n","1929 the companion theory for the “blue chips” was that no price\n","was too high for them because their future possibilities were limit-\n","less. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive\n","of serious investment errors. Actually, the typical middle-sized\n","listed company is a large one when compared with the average pri-\n","vately owned business. There is no sound reason why such compa-\n","nies should not continue indefinitely in operation, undergoing the\n","vicissitudes characteristic of our economy but earning on the\n","whole a fair return on their invested capital.\n","This brief review indicates that the stock market’s attitude\n","toward secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and conse-\n","quently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major\n","undervaluation. As it happens, the World War II period and the\n","postwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to\n","the larger ones, because then the normal competition for sales was\n","suspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins\n","more spectacularly. Thus by 1946 the market’s pattern had com-\n","pletely reversed itself from that before the war. Whereas the lead-\n","ing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only\n","40% from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard & Poor’s index\n","of low-priced stocks had shot up no less than 280% in the same\n","period. Speculators and many self-styled investors—with the\n","proverbial short memories of people in the stock market—were\n","eager to buy both old and new issues of unimportant companies at\n","inflated levels. Thus the pendulum had swung clear to the oppo-\n","site extreme. The very class of secondary issues that had formerly\n","supplied by far the largest proportion of bargain opportunities was\n","now presenting the greatest number of examples of overenthusi-\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","171\n","asm and overvaluation. In a different way this phenomenon was\n","repeated in 1961 and 1968—the emphasis now being placed on\n","new offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second-\n","ary character, and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields\n","such as “electronics,” “computers,” “franchise” concerns, and oth-\n","ers.*\n","As was to be expected the ensuing market declines fell most\n","heavily on these overvaluations. In some cases the pendulum\n","swing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation.\n","If most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what\n","reason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit-\n","uation? For if it persists indefinitely, will he not always be in the\n","same market position as when he bought the issue? The answer\n","here is somewhat complicated. Substantial profits from the pur-\n","chase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of\n","ways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the rein-\n","vested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will\n","ultimately affect the price. In a five- to seven-year period these\n","advantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull\n","market is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it\n","tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level.\n","Fourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a contin-\n","uous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary\n","issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level\n","for their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many\n","172\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed large\n","stocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year. The\n","investing public eagerly embraced small stocks, mutual fund companies\n","rolled out hundreds of new funds specializing in them, and small stocks\n","obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage points per year\n","over the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when small stocks beat\n","big stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring investment bankers to\n","sell hundreds of hot little high-tech stocks to the public for the first time.\n","Instead of “electronics,” “computers,” or “franchise” in their names, the new\n","buzzwords were “.com,” “optical,” “wireless,” and even prefixes like “e-” and\n","“I-.” Investing buzzwords always turn into buzz saws, tearing apart anyone\n","who believes in them.\n","cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be cor-\n","rected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new\n","policies, or by a change in management.\n","An important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition\n","of smaller companies by larger ones, usually as part of a diversifi-\n","cation program. In these cases the consideration paid has almost\n","always been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain\n","levels existing not long before.\n","When interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of\n","bargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at\n","large discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have\n","a different situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large\n","discounts if carrying coupon rates of, say, 41⁄2% or less. Example:\n","American Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄8s, due 1986, sold as low as 51\n","in 1970; Deere & Co. 41⁄2s, due 1983, sold as low as 62. These may\n","well turn out to have been bargain opportunities before very\n","long—if ruling interest rates should decline substantially. For a\n","bargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall\n","have to turn once more to the first-mortgage bonds of railroads\n","now in financial difficulties, which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situa-\n","tions are not for the inexpert investor; lacking a real sense of values\n","in this area, he may burn his fingers. But there is an underlying ten-\n","dency for market decline in this field to be overdone; consequently\n","the group as a whole offers an especially rewarding invitation to\n","careful and courageous analysis. In the decade ending in 1948 the\n","billion-dollar group of defaulted railroad bonds presented numer-\n","ous and spectacular opportunities in this area. Such opportunities\n","have been quite scarce since then; but they seem likely to return in\n","the 1970s.*\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","173\n","* Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities today. How-\n","ever, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds, as well as con-\n","vertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer real value in the\n","wake of the 2000–2002 market crash. But diversification in this area is\n","essential—and impractical without at least $100,000 to dedicate to dis-\n","tressed securities alone. Unless you are a millionaire several times over, this\n","kind of diversification is not an option.\n","Special Situations, or “Workouts”\n","Not so long ago this was a field which could almost guarantee\n","an attractive rate of return to those who knew their way around in\n","it; and this was true under almost any sort of general market situa-\n","tion. It was not actually forbidden territory to members of the gen-\n","eral public. Some who had a flair for this sort of thing could learn\n","the ropes and become pretty capable practitioners without the\n","necessity of long academic study or apprenticeship. Others have\n","been keen enough to recognize the underlying soundness of this\n","approach and to attach themselves to bright young men who \n","handled funds devoted chiefly to these “special situations.” But \n","in recent years, for reasons we shall develop later, the field of “arbi-\n","trages and workouts” became riskier and less profitable. It may \n","be that in years to come conditions in this field will become more\n","propitious. In any case it is worthwhile outlining the general\n","nature and origin of these operations, with one or two illustrative\n","examples.\n","The typical “special situation” has grown out of the increasing\n","number of acquisitions of smaller firms by large ones, as the gospel\n","of diversification of products has been adopted by more and more\n","managements. It often appears good business for such an enter-\n","prise to acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter\n","rather than to start a new venture from scratch. In order to make\n","such acquisition possible, and to obtain acceptance of the deal by\n","the required large majority of shareholders of the smaller company,\n","it is almost always necessary to offer a price considerably above \n","the current level. Such corporate moves have been producing inter-\n","esting profit-making opportunities for those who have made a\n","study of this field, and have good judgment fortified by ample\n","experience.\n","A great deal of money was made by shrewd investors not so\n","many years ago through the purchase of bonds of railroads in\n","bankruptcy—bonds which they knew would be worth much more\n","than their cost when the railroads were finally reorganized. After\n","promulgation of the plans of reorganization a “when issued” mar-\n","ket for the new securities appeared. These could almost always be\n","sold for considerably more than the cost of the old issues which\n","were to be exchanged therefor.

An old Wall Street motto has been: “Never\n","buy into a lawsuit.” This may be sound advice to the speculator\n","seeking quick action on his holdings.

The aggressive investor\n","must have a considerable knowledge of security values—enough,\n","in fact, to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to\n","a business enterprise. There is no room in this philosophy for a\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","175\n","* A classic recent example is Philip Morris, whose stock lost 23% in two\n","days after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive damages of\n","up to $200 billion against the company—which had finally admitted that cig-\n","arettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip Morris’s stock had doubled—\n","only to fall back after a later multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois. Several\n","other stocks have been virtually destroyed by liability lawsuits, including\n","Johns Manville, W. R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, “never buy into a law-\n","suit” remains a valid rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.\n","middle ground, or a series of gradations, between the passive and\n","aggressive status. Many, perhaps most, investors seek to place\n","themselves in such an intermediate category; in our opinion that is\n","a compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than\n","achievement.\n","As an investor you cannot soundly become “half a business-\n","man,” expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business\n","profits on your funds.\n","It follows from this reasoning that the majority of security own-\n","ers should elect the defensive classification. They do not have the\n","time, or the determination, or the mental equipment to embark\n","upon investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satis-\n","fied with the excellent return now obtainable from a defensive\n","portfolio (and with even less), and they should stoutly resist the\n","recurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other\n","paths.\n","The enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu-\n","rity operation for which his training and judgment are adequate\n","and which appears sufficiently promising when measured by estab-\n","lished business standards.\n","In our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors\n","we have attempted to apply such business standards. In those for\n","the defensive investor we have been guided largely by the three\n","requirements of underlying safety, simplicity of choice, and prom-\n","ise of satisfactory results, in terms of psychology as well as arith-\n","metic. The use of these criteria has led us to exclude from the field\n","of recommended investment a number of security classes that are\n","normally regarded as suitable for various kinds of investors. These\n","prohibitions were listed in our first chapter on p. 30.\n","Let us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in\n","these exclusions. We have advised against the purchase at “full\n","prices” of three important categories of securities: (1) foreign\n","bonds, (2) ordinary preferred stocks, and (3) secondary common\n","stocks, including, of course, original offerings of such issues. By\n","“full prices” we mean prices close to par for bonds or preferred\n","stocks, and prices that represent about the fair business value of\n","the enterprise in the case of common stocks. The greater number \n","of defensive investors are to avoid these categories regardless of\n","price; the enterprising investor is to buy them only when obtain-\n","176\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","able at bargain prices—which we define as prices not more than\n","two-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities.\n","What would happen if all investors were guided by our advice\n","in these matters? That question was considered in regard to for-\n","eign bonds, on p. 138, and we have nothing to add at this point.\n","Investment-grade preferred stocks would be bought solely by cor-\n","porations, such as insurance companies, which would benefit from\n","the special income-tax status of stock issues owned by them.\n","The most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is\n","in the field of secondary common stocks. If the majority of\n","investors, being in the defensive class, are not to buy them at all,\n","the field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted. Further-\n","more, if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels,\n","then these issues would be doomed to sell for less than their fair\n","value, except to the extent that they were purchased unintelli-\n","gently.\n","This may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth\n","we are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area\n","for the greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the\n","most part, do fluctuate about a central level which is well below\n","their fair value. They reach and even surpass that value at times;\n","but this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-\n","sons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of\n","paying the prevailing prices for common stocks.\n","Thus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog-\n","nize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they\n","accept the central market levels that are normal for that class as\n","their guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.\n","There is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected\n","secondary company may be fully as promising as the average\n","industrial leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil-\n","ity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Con-\n","sequently it may appear illogical to many readers to term\n","“unintelligent” the purchase of such secondary issues at their full\n","“enterprise value.” We think that the strongest logic is that of expe-\n","rience. Financial history says clearly that the investor may expect\n","satisfactory results, on the average, from secondary common\n","stocks only if he buys them for less than their value to a private\n","owner, that is, on a bargain basis.\n","Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side\n","177\n","The last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the ordi-\n","nary outside investor. Anyone who can control a secondary com-\n","pany, or who is part of a cohesive group with such control, is fully\n","justified in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were invest-\n","ing in a “close corporation” or other private business. The distinc-\n","tion between the position, and consequent investment policy, of\n","insiders and of outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise\n","itself becomes less important. It is a basic characteristic of a primary\n","or leading company that a single detached share is ordinarily\n","worth as much as a share in a controlling block. In secondary com-\n","panies the average market value of a detached share is substantially\n","less than its worth to a controlling owner. Because of this fact, the\n","matter of shareholder-management relations and of those between\n","inside and outside shareholders tends to be much more important\n","and controversial in the case of secondary than in that of primary\n","companies.\n","At the end of Chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of mak-\n","ing any hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary\n","companies. The many common stocks in the boundary area may\n","properly exhibit an intermediate price behavior. It would not be\n","illogical for an investor to buy such an issue at a small discount\n","from its indicated or appraisal value, on the theory that it is only a\n","small distance away from a primary classification and that it may\n","acquire such a rating unqualifiedly in the not too distant future.\n","Thus the distinction between primary and secondary issues\n","need not be made too precise; for, if it were, then a small difference\n","in quality must produce a large differential in justified purchase\n","price. In saying this we are admitting a middle ground in the clas-\n","sification of common stocks, although we counseled against such a\n","middle ground in the classification of investors. Our reason for this\n","apparent inconsistency is as follows: No great harm comes from\n","some uncertainty of viewpoint regarding a single security, because\n","such cases are exceptional and not a great deal is at stake in the\n","matter. But the investor’s choice as between the defensive or the\n","aggressive status is of major consequence to him, and he should\n","not allow himself to be confused or compromised in this basic deci-\n","sion.\n","178\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 7\n","It requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution\n","to make a great fortune; and when you have got it, it requires\n","ten times as much wit to keep it.\n","—Nathan Mayer Rothschild\n","T I M I N G  I S  N O T H I N G\n","In an ideal world, the intelligent investor would hold stocks only when\n","they are cheap and sell them when they become overpriced, then\n","duck into the bunker of bonds and cash until stocks again become\n","cheap enough to buy.

Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual\n","funds that hold foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets)\n","helps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be\n","the best place in the world to invest.\n","Commentary on Chapter 7\n","187\n","CHAPTER 8\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","To the extent that the investor’s funds are placed in high-grade\n","bonds of relatively short maturity—say, of seven years or less—he\n","will not be affected significantly by changes in market prices and\n","need not take them into account. (This applies also to his holdings\n","of U.S. savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price\n","or more.) His longer-term bonds may have relatively wide price\n","swings during their lifetimes, and his common-stock portfolio is\n","almost certain to fluctuate in value over any period of several\n","years.\n","The investor should know about these possibilities and should\n","be prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will\n","want to benefit from changes in market levels—certainly through\n","an advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, and\n","perhaps also by making purchases and sales at advantageous\n","prices. This interest on his part is inevitable, and legitimate\n","enough. But it involves the very real danger that it will lead him\n","into speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you\n","not to speculate; the hard thing will be for you to follow this\n","advice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want to\n","speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-\n","bly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to\n","separate it completely from your investment program.\n","We shall deal first with the more important subject of price\n","changes in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds. \n","In Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market’s\n","action over the past hundred years. In this section we shall return\n","to that material from time to time, in order to see what the past\n","record promises the investor—in either the form of long-term\n","appreciation of a portfolio held relatively unchanged through \n","188\n","successive rises and declines, or in the possibilities of buying \n","near bear-market lows and selling not too far below bull-market\n","highs.\n","Market Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions\n","Since common stocks, even of investment grade, are subject to\n","recurrent and wide fluctuations in their prices, the intelligent\n","investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from\n","these pendulum swings. There are two possible ways by which \n","he may try to do this: the way of timing and the way of pricing.\n","By timing we mean the endeavor to anticipate the action of the\n","stock market—to buy or hold when the future course is deemed \n","to be upward, to sell or refrain from buying when the course \n","is downward. By pricing we mean the endeavor to buy stocks\n","when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when\n","they rise above such value. A less ambitious form of pricing is \n","the simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not \n","pay too much for your stocks. This may suffice for the defen-\n","sive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as \n","such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market \n","levels.1\n","We are convinced that the intelligent investor can derive satis-\n","factory results from pricing of either type. We are equally sure that\n","if he places his emphasis on timing, in the sense of forecasting, he\n","will end up as a speculator and with a speculator’s financial\n","results. This distinction may seem rather tenuous to the layman,\n","and it is not commonly accepted on Wall Street. As a matter of\n","business practice, or perhaps of thoroughgoing conviction, the\n","stock brokers and the investment services seem wedded to the\n","principle that both investors and speculators in common stocks\n","should devote careful attention to market forecasts.\n","The farther one gets from Wall Street, the more skepticism one\n","will find, we believe, as to the pretensions of stock-market forecast-\n","ing or timing. The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumer-\n","able predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the\n","asking. Yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts\n","upon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is impor-\n","tant for him to form some opinion of the future course of the stock\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","189\n","market, and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast\n","is at least more dependable than his own.*\n","We lack space here to discuss in detail the pros and cons of mar-\n","ket forecasting. A great deal of brain power goes into this field, and\n","undoubtedly some people can make money by being good stock-\n","market analysts. But it is absurd to think that the general public can\n","ever make money out of market forecasts. For who will buy when\n","the general public, at a given signal, rushes to sell out at a profit? If\n","you, the reader, expect to get rich over the years by following some\n","system or leadership in market forecasting, you must be expecting\n","to try to do what countless others are aiming at, and to be able to\n","do it better than your numerous competitors in the market. There\n","is no basis either in logic or in experience for assuming that any\n","typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more\n","successfully than the general public, of which he is himself a part.\n","There is one aspect of the “timing” philosophy which seems to\n","have escaped everyone’s notice. Timing is of great psychological\n","importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in\n","190\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In the late 1990s, the forecasts of “market strategists” became more influ-\n","ential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become more accurate.\n","On March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite index hit its\n","all-time high of 5048.62, Prudential Securities’s chief technical analyst\n","Ralph Acampora said in USA Today that he expected NASDAQ to hit 6000\n","within 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had already shriveled to\n","3321.29—but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &\n","Jenrette, declared that “there’s only 200 or 300 points of downside for the\n","NASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It turned out that there were no points\n","on the upside and more than 2000 on the downside, as NASDAQ kept\n","crashing until it finally scraped bottom on October 9, 2002, at 1114.11. In\n","March 2001, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman,\n","Sachs & Co., predicted that the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index would\n","close the year at 1,650 and that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would\n","finish 2001 at 13,000. “We do not expect a recession,” said Cohen, “and\n","believe that corporate profits are likely to grow at close to trend growth\n","rates later this year.” The U.S. economy was sinking into recession even as\n","she spoke, and the S & P 500 ended 2001 at 1148.08, while the Dow fin-\n","ished at 10,021.50—30% and 23% below her forecasts, respectively.\n","a hurry. The idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is\n","repugnant to him. But a waiting period, as such, is of no conse-\n","quence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having\n","his money uninvested until he receives some (presumably) trust-\n","worthy signal that the time has come to buy? He enjoys an advan-\n","tage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently\n","lower price to offset his loss of dividend income. What this means is\n","that timing is of no real value to the investor unless it coincides\n","with pricing—that is, unless it enables him to repurchase his shares\n","at substantially under his previous selling price.\n","In this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and\n","sales has had an unusual history.* Briefly, this technique takes its\n","signal to buy from a special kind of “breakthrough” of the stock\n","averages on the up side, and its selling signal from a similar break-\n","through on the down side. The calculated—not necessarily\n","actual—results of using this method showed an almost unbroken\n","series of profits in operations from 1897 to the early 1960s. On the\n","basis of this presentation the practical value of the Dow theory\n","would have appeared firmly established; the doubt, if any, would\n","apply to the dependability of this published “record” as a picture\n","of what a Dow theorist would actually have done in the market.\n","A closer study of the figures indicates that the quality of the\n","results shown by the Dow theory changed radically after 1938—\n","a few years after the theory had begun to be taken seriously on\n","Wall Street. Its spectacular achievement had been in giving a sell\n","signal, at 306, about a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping\n","its followers out of the long bear market until things had pretty\n","well righted themselves, at 84, in 1933. But from 1938 on the Dow\n","theory operated mainly by taking its practitioners out at a pretty\n","good price but then putting them back in again at a higher price.\n","For nearly 30 years thereafter, one would have done appreciably\n","better by just buying and holding the DJIA.2\n","In our view, based on much study of this problem, the change in\n","the Dow-theory results is not accidental. It demonstrates an inher-\n","ent characteristic of forecasting and trading formulas in the fields\n","of business and finance. Those formulas that gain adherents and\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","191\n","* See p. 3.\n","importance do so because they have worked well over a period, or\n","sometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the\n","statistical record of the past. But as their acceptance increases, their\n","reliability tends to diminish. This happens for two reasons: First,\n","the passage of time brings new conditions which the old formula\n","no longer fits. Second, in stock-market affairs the popularity of a\n","trading theory has itself an influence on the market’s behavior\n","which detracts in the long run from its profit-making possibilities.\n","(The popularity of something like the Dow theory may seem to cre-\n","ate its own vindication, since it would make the market advance or\n","decline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling\n","signal is given. A “stampede” of this kind is, of course, much more\n","of a danger than an advantage to the public trader.)\n","Buy-Low–Sell-High Approach\n","We are convinced that the average investor cannot deal success-\n","fully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can\n","he benefit from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying\n","after each major decline and selling out after each major advance?\n","The fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to\n","1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classic\n","definition of a “shrewd investor” was “one who bought in a bear\n","market when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull mar-\n","ket when everyone else was buying.” If we examine our Chart I,\n","covering the fluctuations of the Standard & Poor’s composite index\n","between 1900 and 1970, and the supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p.\n","66), we can readily see why this viewpoint appeared valid until\n","fairly recent years.\n","Between 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles,\n","running from bear-market low to bull-market high and back to\n","bear-market low. Six of these took no longer than four years, four\n","ran for six or seven years, and one—the famous “new-era” cycle of\n","1921–1932—lasted eleven years. The percentage of advance from\n","the lows to highs ranged from 44% to 500%, with most between\n","about 50% and 100%. The percentage of subsequent declines\n","ranged from 24% to 89%, with most found between 40% and 50%.\n","(It should be remembered that a decline of 50% fully offsets a pre-\n","ceding advance of 100%.)\n","192\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","Nearly all the bull markets had a number of well-defined char-\n","acteristics in common, such as (1) a historically high price level, (2)\n","high price/earnings ratios, (3) low dividend yields as against bond\n","yields, (4) much speculation on margin, and (5) many offerings of\n","new common-stock issues of poor quality. Thus to the student of\n","stock-market history it appeared that the intelligent investor\n","should have been able to identify the recurrent bear and bull mar-\n","kets, to buy in the former and sell in the latter, and to do so for the\n","most part at reasonably short intervals of time. Various methods\n","were developed for determining buying and selling levels of the\n","general market, based on either value factors or percentage move-\n","ments of prices or both.\n","But we must point out that even prior to the unprecedented bull\n","market that began in 1949, there were sufficient variations in the\n","successive market cycles to complicate and sometimes frustrate the\n","desirable process of buying low and selling high. The most notable\n","of these departures, of course, was the great bull market of the late\n","1920s, which threw all calculations badly out of gear.* Even in 1949,\n","therefore, it was by no means a certainty that the investor could\n","base his financial policies and procedures mainly on the endeavor\n","to buy at low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high levels in\n","bull markets.\n","It turned out, in the sequel, that the opposite was true. The\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","193\n","* Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone waiting to\n","“buy low” will feel completely left behind—and, all too often, will end up\n","abandoning any former caution and jumping in with both feet. That’s why\n","Graham’s message about the importance of emotional discipline is so\n","important. From October 1990 through January 2000, the Dow Jones\n","Industrial Average marched relentlessly upward, never losing more than\n","20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The total gain\n","(not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall, Pierce & Co., this\n","was the second-longest uninterrupted bull market of the past century; only\n","the 1949–1961 boom lasted longer. The longer a bull market lasts, the\n","more severely investors will be afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so,\n","many people no longer believe that bear markets are even possible. All\n","those who forget are doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market,\n","recovered memories are always unpleasant.\n","market’s behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the former\n","pattern, nor obeyed what once were well-established danger sig-\n","nals, nor permitted its successful exploitation by applying old rules\n","for buying low and selling high. Whether the old, fairly regular\n","bull-and-bear-market pattern will eventually return we do not\n","know. But it seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to\n","base his present policy on the classic formula—i.e., to wait for\n","demonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common\n","stocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision \n","for changes in the proportion of common stocks to bonds in the\n","portfolio, if the investor chooses to do so, according as the level \n","of stock prices appears less or more attractive by value stan-\n","dards.*\n","Formula Plans\n","In the early years of the stock-market rise that began in 1949–50\n","considerable interest was attracted to various methods of taking\n","advantage of the stock market’s cycles. These have been known as\n","“formula investment plans.” The essence of all such plans—except\n","the simple case of dollar averaging—is that the investor automati-\n","cally does some selling of common stocks when the market\n","advances substantially. In many of them a very large rise in the\n","market level would result in the sale of all common-stock holdings;\n","others provided for retention of a minor proportion of equities\n","under all circumstances.\n","This approach had the double appeal of sounding logical (and\n","conservative) and of showing excellent results when applied retro-\n","spectively to the stock market over many years in the past. Unfor-\n","tunately, its vogue grew greatest at the very time when it was\n","destined to work least well. Many of the “formula planners” found\n","themselves entirely or nearly out of the stock market at some level\n","in the middle 1950s. True, they had realized excellent profits, but in\n","a broad sense the market “ran away” from them thereafter, and\n","194\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Graham discusses this “recommended policy” in Chapter 4 (pp. 89–91).\n","This policy, now called “tactical asset allocation,” is widely followed by insti-\n","tutional investors like pension funds and university endowments.\n","their formulas gave them little opportunity to buy back a common-\n","stock position.*\n","There is a similarity between the experience of those adopting\n","the formula-investing approach in the early 1950s and those who\n","embraced the purely mechanical version of the Dow theory some\n","20 years earlier. In both cases the advent of popularity marked\n","almost the exact moment when the system ceased to work well. We\n","have had a like discomfiting experience with our own “central\n","value method” of determining indicated buying and selling levels\n","of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The moral seems to be that\n","any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be\n","easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too\n","simple and too easy to last.† Spinoza’s concluding remark applies\n","to Wall Street as well as to philosophy: “All things excellent are as\n","difficult as they are rare.”\n","Market Fluctuations of the Investor’s Portfolio\n","Every investor who owns common stocks must expect to see\n","them fluctuate in value over the years. The behavior of the DJIA\n","since our last edition was written in 1964 probably reflects pretty\n","well what has happened to the stock portfolio of a conservative\n","investor who limited his stock holdings to those of large, promi-\n","nent, and conservatively financed corporations. The overall value\n","advanced from an average level of about 890 to a high of 995 in\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","195\n","* Many of these “formula planners” would have sold all their stocks at the\n","end of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the second-highest\n","yearly return then on record.

(Note\n","that, in referring to his “discomfiting experience,” Graham is—as always—\n","honest in admitting his own failures.) See Jason Zweig, “Murphy Was an\n","Investor,” Money, July, 2002, pp. 61–62, and Jason Zweig, “New Year’s\n","Play,” Money, December, 2000, pp. 89–90.\n","1966 (and 985 again in 1968), fell to 631 in 1970, and made an\n","almost full recovery to 940 in early 1971.

We have traced through the\n","price fluctuations of other types of diversified and conservative \n","common-stock portfolios and we find that the overall results are\n","not likely to be markedly different from the above. In general, the\n","shares of second-line companies* fluctuate more widely than the\n","major ones, but this does not necessarily mean that a group of well-\n","established but smaller companies will make a poorer showing\n","over a fairly long period. In any case the investor may as well\n","resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere\n","possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more\n","from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more\n","from their high point at various periods in the next five years.†\n","A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or\n","even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him\n","richer or poorer. But what about the longer-term and wider\n","changes? Here practical questions present themselves, and the psy-\n","chological problems are likely to grow complicated. A substantial\n","rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for satisfaction and\n","a cause for prudent concern, but it may also bring a strong tempta-\n","tion toward imprudent action.

A regularly revised list of the 500 stocks in the S & P index\n","is available at www.standardandpoors.com.\n","† Note carefully what Graham is saying here. It is not just possible, but prob-\n","able, that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50% from their low-\n","est price and lose at least 33% from their highest price—regardless of which\n","stocks you own or whether the market as a whole goes up or down. If you\n","can’t live with that—or you think your portfolio is somehow magically exempt\n","from it—then you are not yet entitled to call yourself an investor. (Graham\n","refers to a 33% decline as the “equivalent one-third” because a 50% gain\n","takes a $10 stock to $15. From $15, a 33% loss [or $5 drop] takes it right\n","back to $10, where it started.)\n","You are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen too high,\n","and should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for\n","not having bought more shares when the level was lower? Or—\n","worst thought of all—should you now give way to the bull-market\n","atmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the overconfi-\n","dence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are\n","a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented\n","thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but\n","even the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will\n","power to keep from following the crowd.\n","It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calcu-\n","lation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechan-\n","ical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the\n","investor’s portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a\n","formula will give him something to do. As the market advances he\n","will from time to time make sales out of his stockholdings, putting\n","the proceeds into bonds; as it declines he will reverse the proce-\n","dure. These activities will provide some outlet for his otherwise\n","too-pent-up energies.

The holder of\n","marketable shares actually has a double status, and with it the\n","privilege of taking advantage of either at his choice. On the one\n","hand his position is analogous to that of a minority shareholder or\n","silent partner in a private business. Here his results are entirely\n","dependent on the profits of the enterprise or on a change in the\n","underlying value of its assets. He would usually determine the\n","value of such a private-business interest by calculating his share of\n","the net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheet. On the\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","197\n","* For today’s investor, the ideal strategy for pursuing this “formula” is rebal-\n","ancing, which we discuss on pp. 104–105.\n","other hand, the common-stock investor holds a piece of paper, an\n","engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes\n","at a price which varies from moment to moment—when the mar-\n","ket is open, that is—and often is far removed from the balance-\n","sheet value.*\n","The development of the stock market in recent decades has\n","made the typical investor more dependent on the course of price\n","quotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a\n","business owner. The reason is that the successful enterprises in\n","which he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantly\n","at prices well above their net asset value (or book value, or \n","“balance-sheet value”). In paying these market premiums the\n","investor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend on\n","the stock market itself to validate his commitments.†\n","This is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing,\n","and it has received less attention than it deserves. The whole struc-\n","ture of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.\n","The better a company’s record and prospects, the less relationship\n","the price of its shares will have to their book value. But the greater\n","the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of deter-\n","mining its intrinsic value—i.e., the more this “value” will depend\n","on the changing moods and measurements of the stock market.\n","Thus we reach the final paradox, that the more successful the com-\n","pany, the greater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its\n","shares. This really means that, in a very real sense, the better the\n","198\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only upon\n","special request.

It can be calculated using the bal-\n","ance sheets in a company’s annual and quarterly reports; from total share-\n","holders’ equity, subtract all “soft” assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and\n","other intangibles. Divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to\n","arrive at book value per share.\n","quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to be—at\n","least as compared with the unspectacular middle-grade issues.*\n","(What we have said applies to a comparison of the leading growth\n","companies with the bulk of well-established concerns; we exclude\n","from our purview here those issues which are highly speculative\n","because the businesses themselves are speculative.)\n","The argument made above should explain the often erratic price\n","behavior of our most successful and impressive enterprises. Our\n","favorite example is the monarch of them all—International Busi-\n","ness Machines. The price of its shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven\n","months in 1962–63; after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in\n","1970. Similarly, Xerox—an even more impressive earnings gainer\n","in recent decades—fell from 171 to 87 in 1962–63, and from 116 to\n","65 in 1970. These striking losses did not indicate any doubt about\n","the future long-term growth of IBM or Xerox; they reflected instead\n","a lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock mar-\n","ket itself had placed on these excellent prospects.\n","The previous discussion leads us to a conclusion of practical\n","importance to the conservative investor in common stocks. If he is\n","to pay some special attention to the selection of his portfolio, it\n","might be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reason-\n","ably close approximation to their tangible-asset value—say, at not\n","more than one-third above that figure. Purchases made at such \n","levels, or lower, may with logic be regarded as related to the\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","199\n","* Graham’s use of the word “paradox” is probably an allusion to a classic\n","article by David Durand, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox,” The\n","Journal of Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957, pp. 348–363, which\n","compares investing in high-priced growth stocks to betting on a series of\n","coin flips in which the payoff escalates with each flip of the coin. Durand\n","points out that if a growth stock could continue to grow at a high rate for \n","an indefinite period of time, an investor should (in theory) be willing to pay\n","an infinite price for its shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a \n","price of infinity dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future\n","growth rate, and the longer the time period over which it is expected, the\n","wider the margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny mis-\n","calculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in Appendix 4\n","(p. 570).\n","company’s balance sheet, and as having a justification or support\n","independent of the fluctuating market prices. The premium over\n","book value that may be involved can be considered as a kind of\n","extra fee paid for the advantage of stock-exchange listing and the\n","marketability that goes with it.\n","A caution is needed here. A stock does not become a sound\n","investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset\n","value. The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio\n","of earnings to price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the\n","prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.\n","This may appear like demanding a lot from a modestly priced\n","stock, but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but danger-\n","ously high market conditions. Once the investor is willing to forgo\n","brilliant prospects—i.e., better than average expected growth—he\n","will have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of issues meeting\n","these criteria.\n","In our chapters on the selection of common stocks (Chapters 14\n","and 15) we shall give data showing that more than half of the DJIA\n","issues met our asset-value criterion at the end of 1970. The most\n","widely held investment of all—American Tel. & Tel.—actually sells\n","below its tangible-asset value as we write. Most of the light-and-\n","power shares, in addition to their other advantages, are now (early\n","1972) available at prices reasonably close to their asset values.\n","The investor with a stock portfolio having such book values\n","behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of\n","stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high multipli-\n","ers of both earnings and tangible assets. As long as the earning\n","power of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can give as little\n","attention as he pleases to the vagaries of the stock market. More\n","than that, at times he can use these vagaries to play the master\n","game of buying low and selling high.\n","The A. & P. Example\n","At this point we shall introduce one of our original examples,\n","which dates back many years but which has a certain fascination\n","for us because it combines so many aspects of corporate and\n","investment experience. It involves the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea\n","Co. Here is the story:\n","200\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","A. & P. shares were introduced to trading on the “Curb” market,\n","now the American Stock Exchange, in 1929 and sold as high as 494.\n","By 1932 they had declined to 104, although the company’s earnings\n","were nearly as large in that generally catastrophic year as previ-\n","ously. In 1936 the range was between 111 and 131. Then in the busi-\n","ness recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low\n","of 36.\n","That price was extraordinary. It meant that the preferred and\n","common were together selling for $126 million, although the com-\n","pany had just reported that it held $85 million in cash alone and a\n","working capital (or net current assets) of $134 million. A. & P. was\n","the largest retail enterprise in America, if not in the world, with a\n","continuous and impressive record of large earnings for many\n","years. Yet in 1938 this outstanding business was considered on\n","Wall Street to be worth less than its current assets alone—which\n","means less as a going concern than if it were liquidated. Why?\n","First, because there were threats of special taxes on chain stores;\n","second, because net profits had fallen off in the previous year; and,\n","third, because the general market was depressed. The first of these\n","reasons was an exaggerated and eventually groundless fear; the\n","other two were typical of temporary influences.\n","Let us assume that the investor had bought A. & P. common in\n","1937 at, say, 12 times its five-year average earnings, or about 80. We\n","are far from asserting that the ensuing decline to 36 was of no\n","importance to him. He would have been well advised to scrutinize\n","the picture with some care, to see whether he had made any mis-\n","calculations. But if the results of his study were reassuring—as\n","they should have been—he was entitled then to disregard the mar-\n","ket decline as a temporary vagary of finance, unless he had the\n","funds and the courage to take advantage of it by buying more on\n","the bargain basis offered.\n","Sequel and Reflections\n","The following year, 1939, A. & P. shares advanced to 1171⁄2, or\n","three times the low price of 1938 and well above the average of\n","1937. Such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no\n","means uncommon, but in the case of A. & P. it was more striking\n","than most. In the years after 1949 the grocery chain’s shares rose\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","201\n","with the general market until in 1961 the split-up stock (10 for 1)\n","reached a high of 701⁄2 which was equivalent to 705 for the 1938\n","shares.\n","This price of 701⁄2 was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the\n","earnings of 1961. Such a price/earnings ratio—which compares\n","with 23 times for the DJIA in that year—must have implied expec-\n","tations of a brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no jus-\n","tification in the company’s earnings record in the preceding years,\n","and it proved completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the\n","course of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward.\n","The year after the 701⁄2 high the price fell by more than half to 34.\n","But this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they\n","showed at the low quotation in 1938. After varying sorts of fluctua-\n","tions the price fell to another low of 211⁄2 in 1970 and 18 in 1972—\n","having reported the first quarterly deficit in its history.\n","We see in this history how wide can be the vicissitudes of a\n","major American enterprise in little more than a single generation,\n","and also with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and\n","pessimism the public has valued its shares. In 1938 the business\n","was really being given away, with no takers; in 1961 the public was\n","clamoring for the shares at a ridiculously high price. After that\n","came a quick loss of half the market value, and some years later a\n","substantial further decline. In the meantime the company was to\n","turn from an outstanding to a mediocre earnings performer; its\n","profit in the boom-year 1968 was to be less than in 1958; it had paid\n","a series of confusing small stock dividends not warranted by the\n","current additions to surplus; and so forth. A. & P. was a larger com-\n","pany in 1961 and 1972 than in 1938, but not as well-run, not as\n","profitable, and not as attractive.*\n","There are two chief morals to this story. The first is that the stock\n","market often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and coura-\n","202\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* The more recent history of A & P is no different. At year-end 1999, its\n","share price was $27.875; at year-end 2000, $7.00; a year later, $23.78; at\n","year-end 2002, $8.06. Although some accounting irregularities later came\n","to light at A & P, it defies all logic to believe that the value of a relatively sta-\n","ble business like groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the\n","next year, then drop by two-thirds the year after that.\n","geous investor can take advantage of its patent errors. The other is\n","that most businesses change in character and quality over the\n","years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse.\n","The investor need not watch his companies’ performance like a\n","hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time.\n","Let us return to our comparison between the holder of mar-\n","ketable shares and the man with an interest in a private business.\n","We have said that the former has the option of considering himself\n","merely as the part owner of the various businesses he has invested\n","in, or as the holder of shares which are salable at any time he\n","wishes at their quoted market price.\n","But note this important fact: The true investor scarcely ever is\n","forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard\n","the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act\n","upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus\n","the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly wor-\n","ried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely\n","transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That\n","man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at\n","all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by\n","other persons’ mistakes of judgment.†\n","Incidentally, a widespread situation of this kind actually existed\n","during the dark depression days of 1931–1933. There was then a\n","psychological advantage in owning business interests that had no\n","quoted market. For example, people who owned first mortgages\n","on real estate that continued to pay interest were able to tell them-\n","selves that their investments had kept their full value, there being\n","no market quotations to indicate otherwise. On the other hand,\n","many listed corporation bonds of even better quality and greater\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","203\n","* “Only to the extent that it suits his book” means “only to the extent that the\n","price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock.” In traditional brokerage\n","lingo, the “book” is an investor’s ledger of holdings and trades.\n","† This may well be the single most important paragraph in Graham’s entire\n","book. In these 113 words Graham sums up his lifetime of experience. You\n","cannot read these words too often; they are like Kryptonite for bear markets.\n","If you keep them close at hand and let them guide you throughout your\n","investing life, you will survive whatever the markets throw at you.\n","underlying strength suffered severe shrinkages in their market\n","quotations, thus making their owners believe they were growing\n","distinctly poorer. In reality the owners were better off with the\n","listed securities, despite the low prices of these. For if they had\n","wanted to, or were compelled to, they could at least have sold the\n","issues—possibly to exchange them for even better bargains. Or\n","they could just as logically have ignored the market’s action as\n","temporary and basically meaningless. But it is self-deception to tell\n","yourself that you have suffered no shrinkage in value merely\n","because your securities have no quoted market at all.\n","Returning to our A. & P. shareholder in 1938, we assert that as\n","long as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their price\n","decline, beyond what his own judgment may have told him was\n","occasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value. If\n","no such shrinkage had occurred, he had a right to expect that in\n","due course the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or\n","better—as in fact it did the following year. In this respect his posi-\n","tion was at least as good as if he had owned an interest in a private\n","business with no quoted market for its shares. For in that case, too,\n","he might or might not have been justified in mentally lopping off\n","part of the cost of his holdings because of the impact of the 1938\n","recession—depending on what had happened to his company.\n","Critics of the value approach to stock investment argue that\n","listed common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in\n","the same way as an interest in a similar private enterprise, because\n","the presence of an organized security market “injects into equity\n","ownership the new and extremely important attribute of liquidity.”\n","But what this liquidity really means is, first, that the investor has\n","the benefit of the stock market’s daily and changing appraisal of\n","his holdings, for whatever that appraisal may be worth, and, second,\n","that the investor is able to increase or decrease his investment at\n","the market’s daily figure—if he chooses. Thus the existence of a\n","quoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not\n","have if his security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current\n","quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from\n","some other source.\n","Let us close this section with something in the nature of a para-\n","ble. Imagine that in some private business you own a small share\n","that cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is\n","204\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","very obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your\n","interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to\n","sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of\n","value appears plausible and justified by business developments\n","and prospects as you know them. Often, on the other hand, Mr.\n","Market lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the\n","value he proposes seems to you a little short of silly.\n","If you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you\n","let Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view of the\n","value of a $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree\n","with him, or in case you want to trade with him. You may be happy\n","to sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price,\n","and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the\n","rest of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the\n","value of your holdings, based on full reports from the company\n","about its operations and financial position.\n","The true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed\n","common stock. He can take advantage of the daily market price or\n","leave it alone, as dictated by his own judgment and inclination. He\n","must take cognizance of important price movements, for otherwise\n","his judgment will have nothing to work on. Conceivably they may\n","give him a warning signal which he will do well to heed—this in\n","plain English means that he is to sell his shares because the price has\n","gone down, foreboding worse things to come. In our view such sig-\n","nals are misleading at least as often as they are helpful. Basically,\n","price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true\n","investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely\n","when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a\n","great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the\n","stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the\n","operating results of his companies.\n","Summary\n","The most realistic distinction between the investor and the spec-\n","ulator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements.\n","The speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting\n","from market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in\n","acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","205\n","movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they\n","alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to\n","buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from\n","buying and probably would be wise to sell.\n","It is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly\n","hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may\n","involve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible\n","missing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better\n","for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to\n","put in stocks, except when the general market level is much higher\n","than can be justified by well-established standards of value. If he\n","wants to be shrewd he can look for the ever-present bargain oppor-\n","tunities in individual securities.\n","Aside from forecasting the movements of the general market,\n","much effort and ability are directed on Wall Street toward selecting\n","stocks or industrial groups that in matter of price will “do better”\n","than the rest over a fairly short period in the future. Logical as this\n","endeavor may seem, we do not believe it is suited to the needs or\n","temperament of the true investor—particularly since he would be\n","competing with a large number of stock-market traders and first-\n","class financial analysts who are trying to do the same thing. As \n","in all other activities that emphasize price movements first and\n","underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds con-\n","stantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-\n","defeating over the years.\n","The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their\n","prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable\n","declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should\n","always remember that market quotations are there for his conve-\n","nience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored. He should\n","never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell one because it has\n","gone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more\n","simply: “Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or\n","sell one immediately after a substantial drop.”\n","An Added Consideration\n","Something should be said about the significance of average mar-\n","ket prices as a measure of managerial competence. The shareholder\n","206\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","judges whether his own investment has been successful in terms\n","both of dividends received and of the long-range trend of the aver-\n","age market value. The same criteria should logically be applied in\n","testing the effectiveness of a company’s management and the\n","soundness of its attitude toward the owners of the business.\n","This statement may sound like a truism, but it needs to be\n","emphasized. For as yet there is no accepted technique or approach\n","by which management is brought to the bar of market opinion. On\n","the contrary, managements have always insisted that they have no\n","responsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of\n","their shares. It is true, of course, that they are not accountable for\n","those fluctuations in price which, as we have been insisting, bear no\n","relationship to underlying conditions and values. But it is only the\n","lack of alertness and intelligence among the rank and file of share-\n","holders that permits this immunity to extend to the entire realm of\n","market quotations, including the permanent establishment of a\n","depreciated and unsatisfactory price level. Good managements\n","produce a good average market price, and bad managements pro-\n","duce bad market prices.*\n","Fluctuations in Bond Prices\n","The investor should be aware that even though safety of its prin-\n","cipal and interest may be unquestioned, a long-term bond could\n","vary widely in market price in response to changes in interest rates.\n","In Table 8-1 we give data for various years back to 1902 covering\n","yields for high-grade corporate and tax-free issues. As individual\n","illustrations we add the price fluctuations of two representative\n","railroad issues for a similar period. (These are the Atchison, Topeka\n","& Santa Fe general mortgage 4s, due 1995, for generations one of\n","our premier noncallable bond issues, and the Northern Pacific Ry.\n","3s, due 2047—originally a 150-year maturity!—long a typical Baa-\n","rated bond.)\n","Because of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond\n","to the high prices and vice versa. The decline in the Northern\n","The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","207\n","* Graham has much more to say on what is now known as “corporate gov-\n","ernance.” See the commentary on Chapter 19.\n","Pacific 3s in 1940 represented mainly doubts as to the safety of the\n","issue. It is extraordinary that the price recovered to an all-time high\n","in the next few years, and then lost two-thirds of its price chiefly\n","because of the rise in general interest rates. There have been star-\n","tling variations, as well, in the price of even the highest-grade\n","bonds in the past forty years.\n","Note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) pro-\n","portion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value\n","of 100% exerts a moderating influence. However, for very long\n","maturities, as in our Northern Pacific example, prices and yields\n","change at close to the same rate.\n","Since 1964 record movements in both directions have taken place\n","in the high-grade bond market. Taking “prime municipals” (tax-\n","free) as an example, their yield more than doubled, from 3.2% in\n","January 1965 to 7% in June 1970. Their price index declined, corre-\n","spondingly, from 110.8 to 67.5. In mid-1970 the yields on high-\n","grade long-term bonds were higher than at any time in the nearly\n","200 years of this country’s economic history.* Twenty-five years earlier,\n","just before our protracted bull market began, bond yields were at\n","their lowest point in history; long-term municipals returned as little\n","as 1%, and industrials gave 2.40% compared with the 41⁄2 to 5% for-\n","merly considered “normal.” Those of us with a long experience on\n","Wall Street had seen Newton’s law of “action and reaction, equal\n","and opposite” work itself out repeatedly in the stock market—the\n","most noteworthy example being the rise in the DJIA from 64 in\n","1921 to 381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932. But\n","this time the widest pendulum swings took place in the usually\n","staid and slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields.\n","Moral: Nothing important on Wall Street can be counted on to\n","occur exactly in the same way as it happened before. This repre-\n","208\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* By what Graham called “the rule of opposites,” in 2002 the yields on long-\n","term U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels since 1963. Since bond\n","yields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that prices had\n","risen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were at their most\n","expensive and as their future returns were almost guaranteed to be low.

Hence the investor\n","must choose between long-term and short-term bond investments\n","on the basis chiefly of his personal preferences. If he wants to be\n","certain that the market values will not decrease, his best choices are\n","probably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or H, which were described\n","above, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5% yield (after the first\n","year), the Series E for up to 55⁄6 years, the Series H for up to ten\n","years, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.\n","If the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term\n","corporate bonds, or the 5.3% on tax-free municipals, he must be\n","prepared to see them fluctuate in price.

A good many of the convertible issues have been sold by\n","companies that have credit ratings well below the best.3 Some of\n","these were badly affected by the financial squeeze in 1970. As a\n","result, convertible issues as a whole have been subjected to triply\n","unsettling influences in recent years, and price variations have\n","been unusually wide.

One possibility would be to\n","sell long-term bonds with interest payments that vary with an\n","appropriate index of the going rate. The main results of such an\n","arrangement would be: (1) the investor’s bond would always have\n","a principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit\n","rating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered\n","on conventional new issues; (2) the corporation would have the\n","advantages of long-term debt—being spared problems and costs of\n","frequent renewals of refinancing—but its interest costs would\n","change from year to year.4\n","Over the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by\n","an increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability\n","of principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term)\n","interest rates? Or shall he choose a fixed-interest income, with \n","considerable variations (usually downward, it seems) in his princi-\n","pal value? It would be good for most investors if they could \n","compromise between these extremes, and be assured that neither\n","their interest return nor their principal value will fall below a\n","stated minimum over, say, a 20-year period.

Had\n","Inktomi’s business dried up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months,\n","the company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what had\n","changed? Only Mr. Market’s mood: In early 2000, investors were \n","so wild about the Internet that they priced Inktomi’s shares at 250\n","times the company’s revenues.

On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc.\n","announced that it would buy Inktomi for $1.65 per share. That was\n","nearly seven times Inktomi’s stock price on September 30.

All of the\n","funds of any importance are registered with the Securities &\n","Exchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and\n","controls.*\n","The industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were\n","383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-\n","lions. Of these 356 companies, with $50.6 billions, were mutual\n","funds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.†\n","There are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the\n","broad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if they\n","have a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,\n","or “stock-funds” if their holdings are nearly all common stocks.\n","(There are some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge\n","226\n","* It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end\n","fund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has\n","“registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.\n","† The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense. At year-end\n","2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding $6.56 trillion; 514 closed-end\n","funds with $149.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade funds or ETFs\n","with $109.7 billion. These figures exclude such fund-like investments as\n","variable annuities and unit investment trusts.\n","funds,” “letter-stock funds,” etc.)* Another is by their objectives, as\n","their primary aim is for income, price stability, or capital apprecia-\n","tion (“growth”). Another distinction is by their method of sale.\n","“Load funds” add a selling charge (generally about 9% of asset\n","value on minimum purchases) to the value before charge.1 Others,\n","known as “no-load” funds, make no such charge; the manage-\n","ments are content with the usual investment-counsel fees for han-\n","dling the capital. Since they cannot pay salesmen’s commissions,\n","the size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side.† The buy-\n","ing and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not fixed by the\n","companies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary\n","corporate stock.\n","Most of the companies operate under special provisions of the\n","income-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double\n","taxation on their earnings. In effect, the funds must pay out vir-\n","tually all their ordinary income—i.e., dividends and interest\n","received, less expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized\n","long-term profits on sales of investments—in the form of “capital-\n","gains dividends”—which are treated by the shareholder as if they\n","were his own security profits. (There is another option here, which\n","we omit to avoid clutter.)‡ Nearly all the funds have but one class\n","Investing in Investment Funds\n","227\n","* Lists of the major types of mutual funds can be found at www.ici.org/\n","pdf/g2understanding.pdf and http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/\n","CategoryReturns.html.

This sort of distribution is extraordinarily rare.\n","* Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially disap-\n","peared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a more\n","flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers like John\n","Neff.

Has\n","it done a good job for its shareholders? In the most general way,\n","how have fund investors fared as against those who made their\n","investments directly? We are quite certain that the funds in the\n","aggregate have served a useful purpose. They have promoted\n","good habits of savings and investment; they have protected count-\n","less individuals against costly mistakes in the stock market; they\n","have brought their participants income and profits commensurate\n","with the overall returns from common stocks. On a comparative\n","basis we would hazard the guess that the average individual who\n","put his money exclusively in investment-fund shares in the past\n","ten years has fared better than the average person who made his\n","common-stock purchases directly.\n","The last point is probably true even though the actual perfor-\n","mance of the funds seems to have been no better than that of com-\n","mon stocks as a whole, and even though the cost of investing in\n","mutual funds may have been greater than that of direct purchases.\n","The real choice of the average individual has not been between\n","constructing and acquiring a well-balanced common-stock portfo-\n","lio or doing the same thing, a bit more expensively, by buying into\n","the funds. More likely his choice has been between succumbing to\n","the wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund salesman on the one\n","hand, as against succumbing to the even wilier and much more\n","dangerous peddlers of second- and third-rate new offerings.

These companies had combined\n","assets of over $15 billion at the end of 1969, or about one-third of all\n","the common-stock funds.

(In theory, there should be a bias in this\n","list on the side of better than industry performance, since these bet-\n","ter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion\n","than the others; but this may not be the case in practice.)\n","Some interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we\n","find that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961–1970 were\n","not appreciably different from those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-\n","stock composite average (or the S & P 425-industrial stock aver-\n","age). But they were definitely better than those of the DJIA. (This\n","raises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the DJIA\n","did worse than the much more numerous and apparently rather\n","miscellaneous list used by Standard & Poor’s.)* A second point is\n","that the funds’ aggregate performance as against the S & P index\n","has improved somewhat in the last five years, compared with the\n","preceding five. The funds’ gain ran a little lower than S & P’s in\n","1961–1965 and a little higher than S & P’s in 1966–1970. The third\n","point is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi-\n","vidual funds.\n","We do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for\n","doing no better than the market as a whole. Their managers and\n","their professional competitors administer so large a portion of all\n","marketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a\n","whole must necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their\n","funds. (Note that the trust assets of insured commercial banks\n","included $181 billion of common stocks at the end of 1969; if we\n","add to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment\n","advisers, plus the $56 billion of mutual and similar funds, we must\n","conclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty\n","well determine the movements of the stock averages, and that the\n","Investing in Investment Funds\n","231\n","* For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S & P 500\n","can diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course of the typical investing\n","lifetime, however—say 25 to 50 years—their returns have tended to converge\n","quite closely.\n","movement of the stock averages pretty well determines the funds’\n","aggregate results.)\n","Are there better than average funds and can the investor select\n","these so as to obtain superior results for himself? Obviously all\n","investors could not do this, since in that case we would soon be\n","back where we started, with no one doing better than anyone else.\n","Let us consider the question first in a simplified fashion. Why\n","shouldn’t the investor find out what fund has made the best show-\n","ing of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past, assume\n","from this that its management is the most capable and will there-\n","fore do better than average in the future, and put his money in that\n","fund? This idea appears the more practicable because, in the case\n","of the mutual funds, he could obtain this “most capable manage-\n","ment” without paying any special premium for it as against the\n","other funds. (By contrast, among noninvestment corporations the\n","best-managed companies sell at correspondingly high prices in\n","relation to their current earnings and assets.)\n","The evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years.\n","But our Table 9-1 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the\n","results shown by the top five performers of 1961–1965 carried over\n","on the whole through 1966–1970, even though two of this set did not\n","do as well as two of the other five. Our studies indicate that the\n","investor in mutual-fund shares may properly consider compara-\n","tive performance over a period of years in the past, say at least five,\n","provided the data do not represent a large net upward movement of\n","the market as a whole. In the latter case spectacularly favorable\n","results may be achieved in unorthodox ways—as will be demon-\n","strated in our following section on “performance” funds. Such\n","results in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are\n","taking undue speculative risks, and getting away with same for the\n","time being.\n","“Performance” Funds\n","One of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance\n","of the cult of “performance” in the management of investment\n","funds (and even of many trust funds).

The story is simple enough. Some of those in\n","charge set out to get much better than average (or DJIA) results.\n","They succeeded in doing this for a while, garnering considerable\n","publicity and additional funds to manage. The aim was legitimate\n","enough; unfortunately, it appears that, in the context of investing\n","really sizable funds, the aim cannot be accomplished without\n","incurring sizable risks. And in a comparatively short time the risks\n","came home to roost.\n","Several of the circumstances surrounding the “performance”\n","phenomenon caused ominous headshaking by those of us whose\n","experience went far back—even to the 1920s—and whose views,\n","for that very reason, were considered old-fashioned and irrelevant\n","to this (second) “New Era.” In the first place, and on this very\n","point, nearly all these brilliant performers were young men—in\n","their thirties and forties—whose direct financial experience was\n","limited to the all but continuous bull market of 1948–1968. Sec-\n","ondly, they often acted as if the definition of a “sound investment”\n","was a stock that was likely to have a good rise in the market in the\n","next few months. This led to large commitments in newer ventures\n","at prices completely disproportionate to their assets or recorded\n","earnings. They could be “justified” only by a combination of naïve\n","hope in the future accomplishments of these enterprises with an\n","apparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of\n","the uninformed and greedy public.\n","This section will not mention people’s names. But we have\n","every reason to give concrete examples of companies. The “perfor-\n","mance fund” most in the public’s eye was undoubtedly Manhattan\n","Fund, Inc., organized at the end of 1965. Its first offering was of 27\n","million shares at $9.25 to $10 per share. The company started out\n","with $247 million of capital. Its emphasis was, of course, on capital\n","gains. Most of its funds were invested in issues selling at high mul-\n","tipliers of current earnings, paying no dividends (or very small\n","ones), with a large speculative following and spectacular price\n","movements. The fund showed an overall gain of 38.6% in 1967,\n","against 11% for the S & P composite index.

Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who were\n","snookered by NSM’s charismatic founder, Cort Randell, were the endow-\n","ment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such presti-\n","gious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.\n","We have presented this picture in order to point a moral, which\n","perhaps can best be expressed by the old French proverb: Plus ça\n","change, plus c’est la même chose.

Investors poured nearly $300 million into\n","Jacob’s fund in the first few weeks of 2000.

That loss may have made Mr. Jacob’s investors even older and wiser\n","than it made him.\n","† Intriguingly, the disastrous boom and bust of 1999–2002 also came\n","roughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity. Perhaps it takes about\n","35 years for the investors who remember the last “New Economy” craze to\n","become less influential than those who do not.

But it is probably too much to expect that\n","the urge to speculate will ever disappear, or that the exploitation of\n","that urge can ever be abolished. It is part of the armament of the\n","intelligent investor to know about these “Extraordinary Popular\n","Delusions,” 4 and to keep as far away from them as possible.\n","The picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we\n","start after their spectacular record in 1967. With the 1967 figures\n","included, their overall showing is not at all disastrous. On that\n","basis one of “The Money Managers” operators did quite a bit better\n","than the S & P composite index, three did distinctly worse, and six\n","did about the same. Let us take as a check another group of perfor-\n","mance funds—the ten that made the best showing in 1967, with\n","gains ranging from 84% up to 301% in that single year. Of these,\n","four gave a better overall four-year performance than the S & P\n","index, if the 1967 gains are included; and two excelled the index in\n","1968–1970.

Thus, there is a strong indication that\n","smaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstand-\n","ing results.\n","The foregoing account contains the implicit conclusion that\n","there may be special risks involved in looking for superior perfor-\n","mance by investment-fund managers.

If\n","they are unsoundly managed they can produce spectacular, but\n","largely illusory, profits for a while, followed inevitably by calami-\n","tous losses. There have been instances of funds that have consis-\n","tently outperformed the market averages for, say, ten years or\n","more.

The closed-end companies, nearly all of which were\n","organized a long time ago, have a fixed capital structure, and thus\n","have diminished in relative dollar importance.

Consequently it has been possible to sell most\n","“mutual funds” to the public at a fixed premium of about 9%\n","above net asset value (to cover salesmen’s commissions, etc.),\n","while the majority of close-end shares have been consistently\n","obtainable at less than their asset value.

If\n","you buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful\n","of cold ashes—but your costs of owning the fund are almost certain\n","not to decline when its returns do.\n","They dare to be different.

The great bulk of investors are ama-\n","teurs. Naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they can\n","profit by professional guidance. Yet there are peculiarities inherent\n","in the very concept of investment advice.\n","If the reason people invest is to make money, then in seeking\n","advice they are asking others to tell them how to make money. That\n","idea has some element of naïveté. Businessmen seek professional\n","advice on various elements of their business, but they do not\n","expect to be told how to make a profit. That is their own bailiwick.\n","When they, or nonbusiness people, rely on others to make invest-\n","ment profits for them, they are expecting a kind of result for which\n","there is no true counterpart in ordinary business affairs.\n","If we assume that there are normal or standard income results to\n","be obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of the\n","adviser can be more readily established. He will use his superior\n","training and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and\n","to make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is\n","entitled. It is when the investor demands more than an average\n","return on his money, or when his adviser undertakes to do better\n","for him, that the question arises whether more is being asked or\n","promised than is likely to be delivered.\n","Advice on investments may be obtained from a variety of\n","sources. These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably knowl-\n","edgeable in securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; (3) a broker-\n","age firm or investment banking house; (4) a financial service or\n","257\n","periodical; and (5) an investment counselor.* The miscellaneous\n","character of this list suggests that no logical or systematic approach\n","in this matter has crystallized, as yet, in the minds of investors.\n","Certain common-sense considerations relate to the criterion of\n","normal or standard results mentioned above. Our basic thesis is\n","this: If the investor is to rely chiefly on the advice of others in han-\n","dling his funds, then either he must limit himself and his advisers\n","strictly to standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of\n","investment, or he must have an unusually intimate and favorable\n","knowledge of the person who is going to direct his funds into other\n","channels. But if the ordinary business or professional relationship\n","exists between the investor and his advisers, he can be receptive to\n","less conventional suggestions only to the extent that he himself has\n","grown in knowledge and experience and has therefore become\n","competent to pass independent judgment on the recommendations\n","of others. He has then passed from the category of defensive or\n","unenterprising investor into that of aggressive or enterprising\n","investor.\n","Investment Counsel and Trust Services of Banks\n","The truly professional investment advisers—that is, the well-\n","established investment counsel firms, who charge substantial\n","annual fees—are quite modest in their promises and pretentions.\n","For the most part they place their clients’ funds in standard inter-\n","est- and dividend-paying securities, and they rely mainly on nor-\n","mal investment experience for their overall results. In the typical\n","case it is doubtful whether more than 10% of the total fund is ever\n","invested in securities other than those of leading companies, plus\n","258\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* The list of sources for investment advice remains as “miscellaneous” as it\n","was when Graham wrote. A survey of investors conducted in late 2002 for\n","the Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade group, found that\n","17% of investors depended most heavily for investment advice on a spouse\n","or friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a broker; 10% on financial periodicals;\n","and 24% on a financial planner. The only difference from Graham’s day is\n","that 8% of investors now rely heavily on the Internet and 3% on financial\n","television.

Their primary aim is to conserve the principal\n","value over the years and produce a conservatively acceptable rate\n","of income. Any accomplishment beyond that—and they do strive\n","to better the goal—they regard in the nature of extra service ren-\n","dered. Perhaps their chief value to their clients lies in shielding\n","them from costly mistakes. They offer as much as the defensive\n","investor has the right to expect from any counselor serving the\n","general public.\n","What we have said about the well-established investment-\n","counsel firms applies generally to the trust and advisory services of\n","the larger banks.*\n","Financial Services\n","The so-called financial services are organizations that send out\n","uniform bulletins (sometimes in the form of telegrams) to their\n","subscribers. The subjects covered may include the state and\n","prospects of business, the behavior and prospect of the securities\n","markets, and information and advice regarding individual issues.\n","There is often an “inquiry department” which will answer que-\n","stons affecting an individual subscriber. The cost of the service\n","averages much less than the fee that investment counselors charge\n","their individual clients. Some organizations—notably Babson’s\n","and Standard & Poor’s—operate on separate levels as a financial\n","service and as investment counsel. (Incidentally, other organiza-\n","The Investor and His Advisers\n","259\n","* The character of investment counseling firms and trust banks has not\n","changed, but today they generally do not offer their services to investors\n","with less than $1 million in financial assets; in some cases, $5 million or\n","more is required. Today thousands of independent financial-planning firms\n","perform very similar functions, although (as analyst Robert Veres puts it) the\n","mutual fund has replaced blue-chip stocks as the investment of choice and\n","diversification has replaced “quality” as the standard of safety.\n","tions—such as Scudder, Stevens & Clark—operate separately as\n","investment counsel and as one or more investment funds.)\n","The financial services direct themselves, on the whole, to a quite\n","different segment of the public than do the investment-counsel\n","firms. The latters’ clients generally wish to be relieved of bother\n","and the need for making decisions. The financial services offer\n","information and guidance to those who are directing their own\n","financial affairs or are themselves advising others. Many of these\n","services confine themselves exclusively, or nearly so, to forecasting\n","market movements by various “technical” methods. We shall dis-\n","miss these with the observation that their work does not concern\n","“investors” as the term is used in this book.\n","On the other hand, some of the best known—such as Moody’s\n","Investment Service and Standard & Poor’s—are identified with\n","statistical organizations that compile the voluminous statistical\n","data that form the basis for all serious security analysis. These ser-\n","vices have a varied clientele, ranging from the most conservative-\n","minded investor to the rankest speculator. As a result they must\n","find it difficult to adhere to any clear-cut or fundamental philoso-\n","phy in arriving at their opinions and recommendations.\n","An old-established service of the type of Moody’s and the others\n","must obviously provide something worthwhile to a broad class of\n","investors. What is it? Basically they address themselves to the mat-\n","ters in which the average active investor-speculator is interested,\n","and their views on these either command some measure of author-\n","ity or at least appear more reliable than those of the unaided client.\n","For years the financial services have been making stock-market\n","forecasts without anyone taking this activity very seriously. Like\n","everyone else in the field they are sometimes right and sometimes\n","wrong. Wherever possible they hedge their opinions so as to avoid\n","the risk of being proved completely wrong. (There is a well-\n","developed art of Delphic phrasing that adjusts itself successfully to\n","whatever the future brings.) In our view—perhaps a prejudiced\n","one—this segment of their work has no real significance except for\n","the light it throws on human nature in the securities markets.\n","Nearly everyone interested in common stocks wants to be told by\n","someone else what he thinks the market is going to do. The\n","demand being there, it must be supplied.\n","Their interpretations and forecasts of business conditions, of\n","260\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","course, are much more authoritative and informing. These are an\n","important part of the great body of economic intelligence which is\n","spread continuously among buyers and sellers of securities and\n","tends to create fairly rational prices for stocks and bonds under\n","most circumstances. Undoubtedly the material published by the\n","financial services adds to the store of information available and for-\n","tifies the investment judgment of their clients.\n","It is difficult to evaluate their recommendations of individual\n","securities. Each service is entitled to be judged separately, and the\n","verdict could properly be based only on an elaborate and inclusive\n","study covering many years. In our own experience we have noted\n","among them a pervasive attitude which we think tends to impair\n","what could otherwise be more useful advisory work. This is their\n","general view that a stock should be bought if the near-term\n","prospects of the business are favorable and should be sold if these\n","are unfavorable—regardless of the current price. Such a superficial\n","principle often prevents the services from doing the sound analyti-\n","cal job of which their staffs are capable—namely, to ascertain\n","whether a given stock appears over- or undervalued at the current\n","price in the light of its indicated long-term future earning power.\n","The intelligent investor will not do his buying and selling solely on\n","the basis of recommendations received from a financial service. Once\n","this point is established, the role of the financial service then becomes\n","the useful one of supplying information and offering suggestions.\n","Advice from Brokerage Houses\n","Probably the largest volume of information and advice to the\n","security-owning public comes from stockbrokers. These are mem-\n","bers of the New York Stock Exchange, and of other exchanges, \n","who execute buying and selling orders for a standard commission.\n","Practically all the houses that deal with the public maintain a \n","“statistical” or analytical department, which answers inquiries \n","and makes recommendations. A great deal of analytical literature,\n","some of it elaborate and expensive, is distributed gratis to the\n","firms’ customers—more impressively referred to as clients.\n","A great deal is at stake in the innocent-appearing question\n","whether “customers” or “clients” is the more appropriate name. A\n","business has customers; a professional person or organization has\n","The Investor and His Advisers\n","261\n","clients. The Wall Street brokerage fraternity has probably the high-\n","est ethical standards of any business, but it is still feeling its way\n","toward the standards and standing of a true profession.*\n","In the past Wall Street has thrived mainly on speculation, and\n","stock-market speculators as a class were almost certain to lose\n","money. Hence it has been logically impossible for brokerage\n","houses to operate on a thoroughly professional basis. To do that\n","would have required them to direct their efforts toward reducing\n","rather than increasing their business.\n","The farthest that certain brokerage houses have gone in that\n","direction—and could have been expected to go—is to refrain from\n","inducing or encouraging anyone to speculate. Such houses have\n","confined themselves to executing orders given them, to supplying\n","financial information and analyses, and to rendering opinions on\n","the investment merits of securities. Thus, in theory at least, they are\n","devoid of all responsibility for either the profits or the losses of\n","their speculative customers.†\n","Most stock-exchange houses, however, still adhere to the old-\n","time slogans that they are in business to make commissions and\n","that the way to succeed in business is to give the customers what\n","they want. Since the most profitable customers want speculative\n","advice and suggestions, the thinking and activities of the typical\n","firm are pretty closely geared to day-to-day trading in the market.\n","Thus it tries hard to help its customers make money in a field\n","where they are condemned almost by mathematical law to lose in\n","the end.‡ By this we mean that the speculative part of their opera-\n","tions cannot be profitable over the long run for most brokerage-\n","262\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall Street has\n","ever seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly cynical enough. Wall\n","Street may have higher ethical standards than some businesses (smug-\n","gling, prostitution, Congressional lobbying, and journalism come to mind)\n","but the investment world nevertheless has enough liars, cheaters, and\n","thieves to keep Satan’s check-in clerks frantically busy for decades to come.\n","† The thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the belief\n","that Wall Street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable advice have\n","learned, in a painful way, how right Graham is on this point.\n","‡ Interestingly, this stinging criticism, which in his day Graham was directing\n","at full-service brokers, ended up applying to discount Internet brokers in the\n","house customers. But to the extent that their operations resemble\n","true investing they may produce investment gains that more than\n","offset the speculative losses.\n","The investor obtains advice and information from stock-\n","exchange houses through two types of employees, now known\n","officially as “customers’ brokers” (or “account executives”) and\n","financial analysts.\n","The customer’s broker, also called a “registered representative,”\n","formerly bore the less dignified title of “customer’s man.” Today\n","he is for the most part an individual of good character and consid-\n","erable knowledge of securities, who operates under a rigid code of\n","right conduct. Nevertheless, since his business is to earn commis-\n","sions, he can hardly avoid being speculation-minded. Thus the\n","security buyer who wants to avoid being influenced by speculative\n","considerations will ordinarily have to be careful and explicit in his\n","dealing with his customer’s broker; he will have to show clearly, by\n","word and deed, that he is not interested in anything faintly resem-\n","bling a stock-market “tip.” Once the customer’s broker under-\n","stands clearly that he has a real investor on his hands, he will\n","respect this point of view and cooperate with it.\n","The financial analyst, formerly known chiefly as security ana-\n","lyst, is a person of particular concern to the author, who has been\n","one himself for more than five decades and has helped educate\n","countless others. At this stage we refer only to the financial ana-\n","lysts employed by brokerage houses. The function of the security\n","analyst is clear enough from his title. It is he who works up the\n","detailed studies of individual securities, develops careful compar-\n","isons of various issues in the same field, and forms an expert opin-\n","ion of the safety or attractiveness or intrinsic value of all the\n","different kinds of stocks and bonds.\n","The Investor and His Advisers\n","263\n","late 1990s. These firms spent millions of dollars on flashy advertising that\n","goaded their customers into trading more and trading faster. Most of those\n","customers ended up picking their own pockets, instead of paying someone\n","else to do it for them—and the cheap commissions on that kind of transac-\n","tion are a poor consolation for the result. More traditional brokerage firms,\n","meanwhile, began emphasizing financial planning and “integrated asset\n","management,” instead of compensating their brokers only on the basis of\n","how many commissions they could generate.\n","By what must seem a quirk to the outsider there are no formal\n","requirements for being a security analyst. Contrast with this the\n","facts that a customer’s broker must pass an examination, meet the\n","required character tests, and be duly accepted and registered by\n","the New York Stock Exchange. As a practical matter, nearly all the\n","younger analysts have had extensive business-school training, and\n","the oldsters have acquired at least the equivalent in the school of\n","long experience. In the great majority of cases, the employing bro-\n","kerage house can be counted on to assure itself of the qualifications\n","and competence of its analysts.*\n","The customer of the brokerage firm may deal with the security\n","analysts directly, or his contact may be an indirect one via the cus-\n","tomer’s broker. In either case the analyst is available to the client\n","for a considerable amount of information and advice. Let us make\n","an emphatic statement here. The value of the security analyst to the\n","investor depends largely on the investor’s own attitude.

The analysts hired by\n","brokerage houses, we are convinced, are greatly handicapped by\n","the general feeling that they are supposed to be market analysts as\n","well.

More than 50,000 analysts\n","worldwide have been certified as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor\n","Stanley Block found that most CFAs ignore Graham’s teachings: Growth\n","potential ranks higher than quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in\n","determining P/E ratios, while far more analysts base their buy ratings on\n","recent price than on the long-term outlook for the company. See Stanley\n","Block, “A Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory,” Financial Ana-\n","lysts Journal, July/August, 1999, at www.aimrpubs.org.

Once\n","the analyst is convinced that he is dealing with a man who is value-\n","minded rather than quotation-minded, there is an excellent chance\n","that his recommendations will prove of real overall benefit.\n","The CFA Certificate for Financial Analysts\n","An important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional\n","standing and responsibility to financial analysts. The official title of\n","chartered financial analyst (CFA) is now awarded to those senior\n","practitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests\n","of fitness.1 The subjects covered include security analysis and port-\n","folio management. The analogy with the long-established profes-\n","sional title of certified public accountant (CPA) is evident and\n","intentional. This relatively new apparatus of recognition and con-\n","trol should serve to elevate the standards of financial analysts and\n","eventually to place their work on a truly professional basis.†\n","The Investor and His Advisers\n","265\n","* It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere commoners to\n","contact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility of institutional investors\n","are permitted to approach the throne of the almighty Wall Street analyst. An indi-\n","vidual investor might, perhaps, have some luck calling analysts who work at\n","“regional” brokerage firms headquartered outside of New York City. The investor\n","relations area at the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a\n","list of analysts who follow the stock. Websites like www.zacks.com and\n","www.multex.com offer access to analysts’ research reports—but the intelligent\n","investor should remember that most analysts do not analyze businesses.\n","Instead, they engage in guesswork about future stock prices.\n","† Benjamin Graham was the prime force behind the establishment of the CFA\n","program, which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became a reality.\n","Dealings with Brokerage Houses\n","One of the most disquieting developments of the period in\n","which we write this revision has been the financial embarrass-\n","ment—in plain words, bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy—of quite a\n","few New York Stock Exchange firms, including at least two of con-\n","siderable size.* This is the first time in half a century or more that\n","such a thing has happened, and it is startling for more than one\n","reason. For many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been\n","moving in the direction of closer and stricter controls over the\n","operations and financial condition of its members—including min-\n","imum capital requirements, surprise audits, and the like. Besides\n","this, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their\n","members by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, \n","the stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable\n","conditions—namely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum\n","commission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-\n","ited number of member firms.\n","The first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969)\n","were attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it was\n","claimed, overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and\n","produced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should\n","be pointed out this was probably the first time in history that\n","important enterprises have gone broke because they had more\n","business than they could handle. In 1970, as brokerage failures\n","increased, they were blamed chiefly on “the falling off in volume.”\n","A strange complaint when one reflects that the turnover of the\n","266\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan\n","& Co. and Goodbody & Co. Du Pont (founded by the heirs to the chemical\n","fortune) was saved from insolvency in 1970 only after Texas entrepreneur \n","H. Ross Perot lent more than $50 million to the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-\n","largest brokerage firm in the United States, would have failed in late 1970\n","had Merrill Lynch not acquired it. Hayden, Stone & Co. would also have\n","gone under if it had not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven bro-\n","kerage firms went bust. The farcical story of Wall Street’s frenzied over-\n","expansion in the late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks’s The Go-Go\n","Years (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999).\n","NYSE in 1970 totaled 2,937 million shares, the largest volume in its\n","history and well over twice as large as in any year before 1965.\n","During the 15 years of the bull market ending in 1964 the annual\n","volume had averaged “only” 712 million shares—one quarter of\n","the 1970 figure—but the brokerage business had enjoyed the great-\n","est prosperity in its history. If, as it appears, the member firms as a\n","whole had allowed their overhead and other expenses to increase\n","at a rate that could not sustain even a mild reduction in volume\n","during part of a year, this does not speak well for either their busi-\n","ness acumen or their financial conservatism.\n","A third explanation of the financial trouble finally emerged out\n","of a mist of concealment, and we suspect that it is the most plausi-\n","ble and significant of the three. It seems that a good part of the cap-\n","ital of certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common\n","stocks owned by the individual partners. Some of these seem to\n","have been highly speculative and carried at inflated values. When\n","the market declined in 1969 the quotations of such securities fell\n","drastically and a substantial part of the capital of the firms van-\n","ished with them.2 In effect the partners were speculating with the\n","capital that was supposed to protect the customers against the\n","ordinary financial hazards of the brokerage business, in order to\n","make a double profit thereon. This was inexcusable; we refrain\n","from saying more.\n","The investor should use his intelligence not only in formulating\n","his financial policies but also in the associated details. These\n","include the choice of a reputable broker to execute his orders. Up to\n","now it was sufficient to counsel our readers to deal only with a\n","member of the New York Stock Exchange, unless he had com-\n","pelling reasons to use a nonmember firm. Reluctantly, we must\n","add some further advice in this area. We think that people who do\n","not carry margin accounts—and in our vocabulary this means all\n","nonprofessional investors—should have the delivery and receipt of\n","their securities handled by their bank. When giving a buying order\n","to your brokers you can instruct them to deliver the securities\n","bought to your bank against payment therefor by the bank; con-\n","versely, when selling you can instruct your bank to deliver the\n","securities to the broker against payment of the proceeds. These ser-\n","vices will cost a little extra but they should be well worth the\n","expense in terms of safety and peace of mind. This advice may be\n","The Investor and His Advisers\n","267\n","disregarded, as no longer called for, after the investor is sure that\n","all the problems of stock-exchange firms have been disposed of,\n","but not before.*\n","Investment Bankers\n","The term “investment banker” is applied to a firm that engages\n","to an important extent in originating, underwriting, and selling\n","new issues of stocks and bonds. (To underwrite means to guaran-\n","tee to the issuing corporation, or other issuer, that the security will\n","be fully sold.) A number of the brokerage houses carry on a certain\n","amount of underwriting activity. Generally this is confined to par-\n","ticipating in underwriting groups formed by leading investment\n","bankers. There is an additional tendency for brokerage firms to\n","originate and sponsor a minor amount of new-issue financing, par-\n","ticularly in the form of smaller issues of common stocks when a\n","bull market is in full swing.\n","Investment banking is perhaps the most respectable department\n","of the Wall Street community, because it is here that finance plays\n","its constructive role of supplying new capital for the expansion of\n","industry. In fact, much of the theoretical justification for maintain-\n","ing active stock markets, notwithstanding their frequent specula-\n","tive excesses, lies in the fact that organized security exchanges\n","facilitate the sale of new issues of bonds and stocks. If investors or\n","speculators could not expect to see a ready market for a new secu-\n","rity offered them, they might well refuse to buy it.\n","The relationship between the investment banker and the\n","268\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Nearly all brokerage transactions are now conducted electronically, and\n","securities are no longer physically “delivered.” Thanks to the establishment\n","of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC, in 1970,\n","investors are generally assured of recovering their full account values if their\n","brokerage firm becomes insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consor-\n","tium of brokers; all the members agree to pool their assets to cover losses\n","incurred by the customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC’s pro-\n","tection eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery\n","through a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.\n","investor is basically that of the salesman to the prospective buyer.\n","For many years past the great bulk of the new offerings in dollar\n","value has consisted of bond issues that were purchased in the main\n","by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. In\n","this business the security salesmen have been dealing with shrewd\n","and experienced buyers. Hence any recommendations made by the\n","investment bankers to these customers have had to pass careful\n","and skeptical scrutiny. Thus these transactions are almost always\n","effected on a businesslike footing.\n","But a different situation obtains in a relationship between the\n","individual security buyer and the investment banking firms, includ-\n","ing the stockbrokers acting as underwriters. Here the purchaser is\n","frequently inexperienced and seldom shrewd. He is easily influ-\n","enced by what the salesman tells him, especially in the case of \n","common-stock issues, since often his unconfessed desire in buying\n","is chiefly to make a quick profit. The effect of all this is that the\n","public investor’s protection lies less in his own critical faculty than\n","in the scruples and ethics of the offering houses.3\n","It is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting\n","firms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles\n","of adviser and salesman. But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust\n","himself to the judgment of the seller. In 1959 we stated at this \n","point: “The bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves\n","recurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the\n","sale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula-\n","tion.” Shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed. As\n","already pointed out, the years 1960–61 and, again, 1968–69 were\n","marked by an unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest qual-\n","ity, sold to the public at absurdly high offering prices and in many\n","cases pushed much higher by heedless speculation and some semi-\n","manipulation. A number of the more important Wall Street houses\n","have participated to some degree in these less than creditable activ-\n","ities, which demonstrates that the familiar combination of greed,\n","folly, and irresponsibility has not been exorcized from the financial\n","scene.\n","The intelligent investor will pay attention to the advice and rec-\n","ommendations received from investment banking houses, espe-\n","cially those known by him to have an excellent reputation; but he\n","will be sure to bring sound and independent judgment to bear\n","The Investor and His Advisers\n","269\n","upon these suggestions—either his own, if he is competent, or that\n","of some other type of adviser.*\n","Other Advisers\n","It is a good old custom, especially in the smaller towns, to con-\n","sult one’s local banker about investments.

The various societies of analysts that\n","make up the National Federation of Financial Analysts have over\n","13,000 members, most of whom make their living out of this\n","branch of mental activity. Financial analysts have textbooks, a code\n","of ethics, and a quarterly journal.* They also have their share of\n","unresolved problems. In recent years there has been a tendency to\n","replace the general concept of “security analysis” by that of “finan-\n","cial analysis.” The latter phrase has a broader implication and is\n","better suited to describe the work of most senior analysts on Wall\n","Street. It would be useful to think of security analysis as limiting\n","itself pretty much to the examination and evaluation of stocks and\n","bonds, whereas financial analysis would comprise that work, plus\n","the determination of investment policy (portfolio selection), plus a\n","substantial amount of general economic analysis.1 In this chapter\n","we shall use whatever designation is most applicable, with chief\n","emphasis on the work of the security analyst proper.\n","The security analyst deals with the past, the present, and the\n","future of any given security issue. He describes the business; he\n","summarizes its operating results and financial position; he sets\n","forth its strong and weak points, its possibilities and risks; he esti-\n","mates its future earning power under various assumptions, or as a\n","280\n","* The National Federation of Financial Analysts is now the Association for\n","Investment Management and Research; its “quarterly” research publication,\n","the Financial Analysts Journal, now appears every other month.\n","“best guess.” He makes elaborate comparisons of various compa-\n","nies, or of the same company at various times. Finally, he expresses\n","an opinion as to the safety of the issue, if it is a bond or investment-\n","grade preferred stock, or as to its attractiveness as a purchase, if it\n","is a common stock.\n","In doing all these things the security analyst avails himself of a\n","number of techniques, ranging from the elementary to the most\n","abstruse. He may modify substantially the figures in the\n","company’s annual statements, even though they bear the sacred\n","imprimatur of the certified public accountant. He is on the lookout\n","particularly for items in these reports that may mean a good deal\n","more or less than they say.\n","The security analyst develops and applies standards of safety by\n","which we can conclude whether a given bond or preferred stock\n","may be termed sound enough to justify purchase for investment.\n","These standards relate primarily to past average earnings, but they\n","are concerned also with capital structure, working capital, asset\n","values, and other matters.\n","In dealing with common stocks the security analyst until\n","recently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined\n","as were his standards of safety for bonds and preferred stocks.\n","Most of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per-\n","formances, a more or less general forecast of the future—with par-\n","ticular emphasis on the next 12 months—and a rather arbitrary\n","conclusion. The latter was, and still is, often drawn with one eye on\n","the stock ticker or the market charts. In the past few years, how-\n","ever, much attention has been given by practicing analysts to the\n","problem of valuing growth stocks. Many of these have sold at such\n","high prices in relation to past and current earnings that those rec-\n","ommending them have felt a special obligation to justify their pur-\n","chase by fairly definite projections of expected earnings running\n","fairly far into the future. Certain mathematical techniques of a\n","rather sophisticated sort have perforce been invoked to support the\n","valuations arrived at.\n","We shall deal with these techniques, in foreshortened form, a lit-\n","tle later. However, we must point out a troublesome paradox here,\n","which is that the mathematical valuations have become most\n","prevalent precisely in those areas where one might consider them\n","least reliable. For the more dependent the valuation becomes on\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","281\n","anticipations of the future—and the less it is tied to a figure\n","demonstrated by past performance—the more vulnerable it\n","becomes to possible miscalculation and serious error. A large part\n","of the value found for a high-multiplier growth stock is derived\n","from future projections which differ markedly from past perfor-\n","mance—except perhaps in the growth rate itself. Thus it may be\n","said that security analysts today find themselves compelled to\n","become most mathematical and “scientific” in the very situations\n","which lend themselves least auspiciously to exact treatment.*\n","Let us proceed, nonetheless, with our discussion of the more\n","important elements and techniques of security analysis. The pres-\n","ent highly condensed treatment is directed to the needs of the non-\n","professional investor. At the minimum he should understand what\n","the security analyst is talking about and driving at; beyond that, he\n","should be equipped, if possible, to distinguish between superficial\n","and sound analysis.\n","Security analysis for the lay investor is thought of as beginning\n","282\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* The higher the growth rate you project, and the longer the future period\n","over which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast becomes to the\n","slightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a company earning $1 per\n","share can raise that profit by 15% a year for the next 15 years, its earnings\n","would end up at $8.14. If the market values the company at 35 times earn-\n","ings, the stock would finish the period at roughly $285. But if earnings grow\n","at 14% instead of 15%, the company would earn $7.14 at the end of the\n","period—and, in the shock of that shortfall, investors would no longer be will-\n","ing to pay 35 times earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would\n","end up around $140 per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced\n","mathematics gives the appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process\n","of foreseeing the future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who\n","claims to hold any complex computational key to basic financial problems.\n","As Graham put it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have\n","never seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\n","related investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most\n","elementary algebra.

In the case of preferred stocks, it is the number of times\n","that bond interest and preferred dividends combined have been\n","covered.\n","The exact standards applied will vary with different authorities.\n","Since the tests are at bottom arbitrary, there is no way to determine\n","precisely the most suitable criteria. In the 1961 revision of our text-\n","book, Security Analysis, we recommend certain “coverage” stan-\n","dards, which appear in Table 11-1.*\n","Our basic test is applied only to the average results for a period\n","of years.

These include the following:\n","1. Size of Enterprise.

This has been strikingly demon-\n","strated in the major field of railroad bonds—a field that has been\n","marked by a calamitous frequency of bankruptcies and serious\n","losses. In nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long\n","been overbonded, had shown an inadequate coverage of fixed\n","charges in periods of average prosperity, and would thus have been\n","ruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety. Conversely,\n","practically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial\n","embarrassment. Our premise was strikingly vindicated by the\n","financial history of the numerous railroads reorganized in the 1940s\n","and in 1950. All of these, with one exception, started their careers\n","with fixed charges reduced to a point where the current coverage of\n","fixed-interest requirements was ample, or at least respectable. The\n","exception was the New Haven Railroad, which in its reorganization\n","year, 1947, earned its new charges only about 1.1 times. In conse-\n","quence, while all the other roads were able to come through rather\n","difficult times with solvency unimpaired, the New Haven relapsed\n","into trusteeship (for the third time) in 1961.\n","In Chapter 17 below we shall consider some aspects of the bank-\n","ruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad, which shook the financial\n","community in 1970. An elementary fact in this case was that the\n","coverage of fixed charges did not meet conservative standards as\n","early as 1965; hence a prudent bond investor would have avoided\n","or disposed of the bond issues of the system long before its finan-\n","cial collapse.\n","Our observations on the adequacy of the past record to judge\n","future safety apply, and to an even greater degree, to the public\n","utilities, which constitute a major area for bond investment.\n","Receivership of a soundly capitalized (electric) utility company or\n","system is almost impossible.

The financial troubles of elec-\n","tric and gas utilities in the 1930s were traceable almost 100% to\n","financial excesses and mismanagement, which left their imprint\n","clearly on the companies’ capitalization structures. Simple but\n","stringent tests of safety, therefore, would have warned the investor\n","away from the issues that were later to default.\n","Among industrial bond issues the long-term record has been\n","different. Although the industrial group as a whole has shown a\n","better growth of earning power than either the railroads or the util-\n","ities, it has revealed a lesser degree of inherent stability for individ-\n","ual companies and lines of business. Thus in the past, at least, there\n","have been persuasive reasons for confining the purchase of indus-\n","trial bonds and preferred stocks to companies that not only are of\n","major size but also have shown an ability in the past to withstand a\n","serious depression.\n","Few defaults of industrial bonds have occurred since 1950, but\n","this fact is attributable in part to the absence of a major depression\n","during this long period. Since 1966 there have been adverse devel-\n","opments in the financial position of many industrial companies.\n","Considerable difficulties have developed as the result of unwise\n","expansion. On the one hand this has involved large additions to\n","both bank loans and long-term debt; on the other it has frequently\n","produced operating losses instead of the expected profits. At the\n","beginning of 1971 it was calculated that in the past seven years the\n","interest payments of all nonfinancial firms had grown from $9.8\n","billion in 1963 to $26.1 billion in 1970, and that interest payments\n","had taken 29% of the aggregate profits before interest and taxes in\n","1971, against only 16% in 1963.3 Obviously, the burden on many\n","individual firms had increased much more than this. Overbonded\n","companies have become all too familiar. There is every reason to\n","repeat the caution expressed in our 1965 edition:\n","We are not quite ready to suggest that the investor may count\n","on an indefinite continuance of this favorable situation, and hence\n","relax his standards of bond selection in the industrial or any other\n","group.\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","287\n","Common-Stock Analysis\n","The ideal form of common-stock analysis leads to a valuation of\n","the issue which can be compared with the current price to deter-\n","mine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase. This val-\n","uation, in turn, would ordinarily be found by estimating the\n","average earnings over a period of years in the future and then mul-\n","tiplying that estimate by an appropriate “capitalization factor.”\n","The now-standard procedure for estimating future earning\n","power starts with average past data for physical volume, prices\n","received, and operating margin. Future sales in dollars are then\n","projected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in\n","volume and price level over the previous base. These estimates, in\n","turn, are grounded first on general economic forecasts of gross\n","national product, and then on special calculations applicable to the\n","industry and company in question.\n","An illustration of this method of valuation may be taken from\n","our 1965 edition and brought up to date by adding the sequel. The\n","Value Line, a leading investment service, makes forecasts of future\n","earnings and dividends by the procedure outlined above, and then\n","derives a figure of “price potentiality” (or projected market value)\n","by applying a valuation formula to each issue based largely on cer-\n","tain past relationships. In Table 11-2 we reproduce the projections\n","for 1967–1969 made in June 1964, and compare them with the earn-\n","ings, and average market price actually realized in 1968 (which\n","approximates the 1967–1969 period).\n","The combined forecasts proved to be somewhat on the low side,\n","but not seriously so. The corresponding predictions made six years\n","before had turned out to be overoptimistic on earnings and divi-\n","dends; but this had been offset by use of a low multiplier, with the\n","result that the “price potentiality” figure proved to be about the\n","same as the actual average price for 1963.\n","The reader will note that quite a number of the individual fore-\n","casts were wide of the mark. This is an instance in support of our\n","general view that composite or group estimates are likely to be a\n","good deal more dependable than those for individual companies.\n","Ideally, perhaps, the security analyst should pick out the three or\n","four companies whose future he thinks he knows the best, and con-\n","centrate his own and his clients’ interest on what he forecasts for\n","288\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","289\n","TABLE 11-2\n","The Dow Jones Industrial Average\n","(The Value Line’s Forecast for 1967–1969 (Made in Mid-1964) Compared\n","With Actual Results in 1968)\n","Earnings\n","Price\n","Price\n","Average\n","Forecast\n","Actual\n","June 30\n","Forecast\n","Price\n","1967–1969\n","1968a\n","1964\n","1967–1969\n","1968a\n","Allied Chemical\n","$3.70\n","$1.46\n","541⁄2\n","67\n","361⁄2\n","Aluminum Corp. of Am.\n","3.85\n","4.75\n","711⁄2\n","85\n","79\n","American Can\n","3.50\n","4.25\n","47\n","57\n","48\n","American Tel. & Tel.\n","4.00\n","3.75\n","731⁄2\n","68\n","53\n","American Tobacco\n","3.00\n","4.38\n","511⁄2\n","33\n","37\n","Anaconda\n","6.00\n","8.12\n","441⁄2\n","70\n","106\n","Bethlehem Steel\n","3.25\n","3.55\n","361⁄2\n","45\n","31\n","Chrysler\n","4.75\n","6.23\n","481⁄2\n","45\n","60\n","Du Pont\n","8.50\n","7.82\n","253\n","240\n","163\n","Eastman Kodak\n","5.00\n","9.32\n","133\n","100\n","320\n","General Electric\n","4.50\n","3.95\n","80\n","90\n","901⁄2\n","General Foods\n","4.70\n","4.16\n","88\n","71\n","841⁄2\n","General Motors\n","6.25\n","6.02\n","88\n","78\n","811⁄2\n","Goodyear Tire\n","3.25\n","4.12\n","43\n","43\n","54\n","Internat.

The ideal choice for most investors is a total stock\n","market index fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning.\n","earnings per share in 1973–1975—say $4—the analyst may value\n","one as low as 40 and the other as high as 100. Let us deal briefly\n","with some of the considerations that enter into these divergent\n","multipliers.\n","1. General Long-Term Prospects. No one really knows anything\n","about what will happen in the distant future, but analysts and\n","investors have strong views on the subject just the same. These\n","views are reflected in the substantial differentials between the\n","price/earnings ratios of individual companies and of industry\n","groups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition:\n","For example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the\n","DJIA were selling at considerably higher multipliers than the oil\n","companies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the\n","former than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market are\n","often soundly based, but when dictated mainly by past perfor-\n","mance they are as likely to be wrong as right.\n","We shall supply here, in Table 11-3, the 1963 year-end material\n","on the chemical and oil company issues in the DJIA, and carry their\n","earnings to the end of 1970. It will be seen that the chemical compa-\n","nies, despite their high multipliers, made practically no gain in\n","earnings in the period after 1963. The oil companies did much bet-\n","ter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in\n","their 1963 multipliers.5 Thus our chemical-stock example proved to\n","be one of the cases in which the market multipliers were proven\n","wrong.*\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","291\n","* Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to\n","nearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall Street’s consensus\n","view of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too\n","pessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its most cheery just when the\n","stocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just when they are cheapest.\n","The most recent example, of course, is technology and telecommunications\n","stocks, which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999\n","and early 2000, and then crashed all the way through 2002. History proves\n","that Wall Street’s “expert” forecasters are equally inept at predicting the\n","TABLE 11-3\n","Performance of Chemical and Oil Stocks in the DJIA, 1970 versus 1964\n","1963\n","1970\n","Closing \n","Earned\n","P/E\n","Closing\n","Earned\n","P/E\n","Price\n","Per Share\n","Ratio\n","Price\n","Per Share\n","Ratio\n","Chemical companies:\n","Allied Chemical\n","55\n","2.77\n","19.8 \u0001\n","241⁄8\n","1.56\n","15.5 \u0001\n","Du Ponta\n","77\n","6.55\n","23.5\n","1331⁄2\n","6.76\n","19.8\n","Union Carbideb\n","601⁄4\n","2.66\n","22.7\n","40\n","2.60\n","15.4\n","25.3 ave.\n","Oil companies:\n","Standard Oil of Cal.\n","591⁄2\n","4.50\n","13.2 \u0001\n","541⁄2\n","5.36\n","10.2 \u0001\n","Standard Oil of N.J.\n","76\n","4.74\n","16.0\n","731⁄2\n","5.90\n","12.4\n","Texacob\n","35\n","2.15\n","16.3\n","35\n","3.02\n","11.6\n","15.3 ave.\n","a 1963 figures adjusted for distribution of General Motors shares.\n","b 1963 figures adjusted for subsequent stock splits.\n","2. Management. On Wall Street a great deal is constantly said on\n","this subject, but little that is really helpful. Until objective, quantita-\n","tive, and reasonably reliable tests of managerial competence are\n","devised and applied, this factor will continue to be looked at\n","through a fog. It is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful\n","company has unusually good management. This will have shown\n","itself already in the past record; it will show up again in the esti-\n","mates for the next five years, and once more in the previously dis-\n","cussed factor of long-term prospects. The tendency to count it still\n","another time as a separate bullish consideration can easily lead to\n","expensive overvaluations. The management factor is most useful,\n","we think, in those cases in which a recent change has taken place\n","that has not yet had the time to show its significance in the actual\n","figures.\n","Two spectacular occurrences of this kind were associated with\n","the Chrysler Motor Corporation. The first took place as far back as\n","1921, when Walter Chrysler took command of the almost mori-\n","bund Maxwell Motors, and in a few years made it a large and\n","highly profitable enterprise, while numerous other automobile\n","companies were forced out of business. The second happened as\n","recently as 1962, when Chrysler had fallen far from its once high\n","estate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years.\n","Then new interests, associated with Consolidation Coal, took over\n","the reins. The earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of $1.24 per\n","share to the equivalent of $17 in 1963, and the price rose from a low\n","of 381⁄2 in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year.6\n","3. Financial Strength and Capital Structure. Stock of a company\n","with a lot of surplus cash and nothing ahead of the common is\n","clearly a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with\n","the same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securi-\n","ties. Such factors are properly and carefully taken into account by\n","security analysts. A modest amount of bonds or preferred stock,\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","293\n","performance of 1) the market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) spe-\n","cific stocks. As Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do\n","any better are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions\n","that are not dependent on the accuracy of anybody’s forecasts, including\n","his or her own. (See Chapter 8.)\n","however, is not necessarily a disadvantage to the common, nor is\n","the moderate use of seasonal bank credit. (Incidentally, a top-heavy\n","structure—too little common stock in relation to bonds and pre-\n","ferred—may under favorable conditions make for a huge specula-\n","tive profit in the common. This is the factor known as “leverage.”)\n","4. Dividend Record. One of the most persuasive tests of high qual-\n","ity is an uninterrupted record of dividend payments going back\n","over many years. We think that a record of continuous dividend\n","payments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor\n","in the company’s quality rating. Indeed the defensive investor\n","might be justified in limiting his purchases to those meeting this\n","test.\n","5. Current Dividend Rate. This, our last additional factor, is the\n","most difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion. Fortunately,\n","the majority of companies have come to follow what may be called\n","a standard dividend policy. This has meant the distribution of\n","about two-thirds of their average earnings, except that in the recent\n","period of high profits and inflationary demands for more capital\n","the figure has tended to be lower. (In 1969 it was 59.5% for the\n","stocks in the Dow Jones average, and 55% for all American corpo-\n","rations.)* Where the dividend bears a normal relationship to the\n","earnings, the valuation may be made on either basis without sub-\n","stantially affecting the result. For example, a typical secondary\n","company with expected average earnings of $3 and an expected\n","dividend of $2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18\n","times its dividend, to yield a value of 36 in both cases.\n","However, an increasing number of growth companies are\n","departing from the once standard policy of paying out 60% or\n","more of earnings in dividends, on the grounds that the sharehold-\n","294\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has dropped consid-\n","erably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged investors from\n","seeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of year-end 2002, the\n","payout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S & P 500-stock index and, as recently\n","as April 2000, it hit an all-time low of just 25.3%. (See www.barra.com/\n","research/fundamentals.asp.) We discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in\n","the commentary on Chapter 19.\n","ers’ interests will be better served by retaining nearly all the profits\n","to finance expansion. The issue presents problems and requires\n","careful distinctions. We have decided to defer our discussion of the\n","vital question of proper dividend policy to a later section—Chapter\n","19—where we shall deal with it as a part of the general problem of\n","management-shareholder relations.\n","Capitalization Rates for Growth Stocks\n","Most of the writing of security analysts on formal appraisals\n","relates to the valuation of growth stocks. Our study of the various\n","methods has led us to suggest a foreshortened and quite simple\n","formula for the valuation of growth stocks, which is intended to\n","produce figures fairly close to those resulting from the more\n","refined mathematical calculations. Our formula is:\n","Value = Current (Normal) Earnings \u0001 (8.5 plus twice \n","the expected annual growth rate)\n","The growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to\n","ten years.7\n","In Table 11-4 we show how our formula works out for various\n","rates of assumed growth. It is easy to make the converse calcula-\n","tion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur-\n","rent market price, assuming our formula is valid. In our last\n","edition we made that calculation for the DJIA and for six important\n","stock issues. These figures are reproduced in Table 11-5. We com-\n","mented at the time:\n","The difference between the implicit 32.4% annual growth rate\n","for Xerox and the extremely modest 2.8% for General Motors is\n","indeed striking. It is explainable in part by the stock market’s feel-\n","ing that General Motors’ 1963 earnings—the largest for any corpo-\n","ration in history—can be maintained with difficulty and exceeded\n","only modestly at best. The price earnings ratio of Xerox, on the\n","other hand, is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas-\n","tened upon a company of great achievement and perhaps still\n","greater promise.\n","The implicit or expected growth rate of 5.1% for the DJIA com-\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","295\n","TABLE 11-4\n","Annual Earnings Multipliers Based on Expected Growth Rates, \n","Based on a Simplified Formula\n","Expected growth rate\n","0.0%\n","2.5%\n","5.0%\n","7.2%\n","10.0%\n","14.3%\n","20.0%\n","Growth in 10 years\n","0.0\n","28.0%\n","63.0%\n","100.0%\n","159.0%\n","280.0%\n","319.0%\n","Multiplier of current earnings\n","8.5\n","13.5\n","18.5\n","22.9\n","28.5\n","37.1\n","48.5\n","TABLE 11-5\n","Implicit or Expected Growth Rates, December 1963 and December 1969\n","Projecteda\n","Earned\n","Actual Annual\n","Projecteda\n","P/E Ratio,\n","Growth Rate,\n","Per Share\n","Growth,\n","P/E Ratio,\n","Growth Rate,\n","Issue\n","1963\n","1963\n","1963\n","1969\n","1963–1969\n","1969\n","1969\n","American Tel. & Tel.\n","23.0 \u0001\n","7.3%\n","3.03\n","4.00\n","4.75%\n","12.2 \u0001\n","1.8%\n","General Electric\n","29.0\n","10.3\n","3.00\n","3.79b\n","4.0\n","20.4\n","6.0\n","General Motors\n","14.1\n","2.8\n","5.55\n","5.95\n","1.17\n","11.6\n","1.6\n","IBM\n","38.5\n","15.0\n","3.48c\n","8.21\n","16.0\n","44.4\n","17.9\n","International Harvester\n","13.2\n","2.4\n","2.29c\n","2.30\n","0.1\n","10.8\n","1.1\n","Xerox\n","25.0\n","32.4\n",".38c\n","2.08\n","29.2\n","50.8\n","21.2\n","DJIA\n","18.6\n","5.1\n","41.11\n","57.02\n","5.5\n","14.0\n","2.8\n","a Based on formula on p. 295.\n","b Average of 1968 and 1970, since 1969 earnings were reduced by strike.\n","c Adjusted for stock splits.\n","pares with an actual annual increase of 3.4% (compounded)\n","between 1951–1953 and 1961–1963.\n","We should have added a caution somewhat as follows: The val-\n","uations of expected high-growth stocks are necessarily on the low\n","side, if we were to assume these growth rates will actually be real-\n","ized. In fact, according to the arithmetic, if a company could be\n","assumed to grow at a rate of 8% or more indefinitely in the future its\n","value would be infinite, and no price would be too high to pay for\n","the shares. What the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro-\n","duce a margin of safety into his calculations—somewhat as an engi-\n","neer does in his specifications for a structure. On this basis the\n","purchases would realize his assigned objective (in 1963, a future\n","overall return of 71⁄2% per annum) even if the growth rate actually\n","realized proved substantially less than that projected in the for-\n","mula. Of course, then, if that rate were actually realized the\n","investor would be sure to enjoy a handsome additional return.\n","There is really no way of valuing a high-growth company (with \n","an expected rate above, say, 8% annually), in which the analyst \n","can make realistic assumptions of both the proper multiplier for \n","the current earnings and the expectable multiplier for the future\n","earnings.\n","As it happened the actual growth for Xerox and IBM proved\n","very close to the high rates implied from our formula. As just\n","explained, this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance\n","in the price of both issues. The growth of the DJIA itself was also\n","about as projected by the 1963 closing market price. But the moder-\n","ate rate of 5% did not involve the mathematical dilemma of Xerox\n","and IBM. It turned out that the 23% price rise to the end of 1970,\n","plus the 28% in aggregate dividend return received, gave not far\n","from the 71⁄2% annual overall gain posited in our formula. In the\n","case of the other four companies it may suffice to say that their\n","growth did not equal the expectations implied in the 1963 price\n","and that their quotations failed to rise as much as the DJIA. Warn-\n","ing: This material is supplied for illustrative purposes only, and\n","because of the inescapable necessity in security analysis to project\n","the future growth rate for most companies studied. Let the reader\n","not be misled into thinking that such projections have any high\n","degree of reliability or, conversely, that future prices can be\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","297\n","counted on to behave accordingly as the prophecies are realized,\n","surpassed, or disappointed.\n","We should point out that any “scientific,” or at least reasonably\n","dependable, stock evaluation based on anticipated future results\n","must take future interest rates into account. A given schedule of\n","expected earnings, or dividends, would have a smaller present\n","value if we assume a higher than if we assume a lower interest\n","structure.* Such assumptions have always been difficult to make\n","with any degree of confidence, and the recent violent swings in\n","long-term interest rates render forecasts of this sort almost pre-\n","sumptuous. Hence we have retained our old formula above, sim-\n","ply because no new one would appear more plausible.\n","Industry Analysis\n","Because the general prospects of the enterprise carry major\n","weight in the establishment of market prices, it is natural for the\n","security analyst to devote a great deal of attention to the economic\n","position of the industry and of the individual company in its\n","industry. Studies of this kind can go into unlimited detail. They are\n","sometimes productive of valuable insights into important factors\n","that will be operative in the future and are insufficiently appreci-\n","ated by the current market. Where a conclusion of that kind can be\n","drawn with a fair degree of confidence, it affords a sound basis for\n","investment decisions.\n","Our own observation, however, leads us to minimize some-\n","what the practical value of most of the industry studies that are\n","made available to investors. The material developed is ordinarily\n","of a kind with which the public is already fairly familiar and that\n","has already exerted considerable influence on market quotations.\n","298\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Why is this? By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount of money\n","doubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in just over 10 years.\n","When interest rates are high, the amount of money you need to set aside \n","today to reach a given value in the future is lower—since those high interest\n","rates will enable it to grow at a more rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates\n","today makes a future stream of earnings or dividends less valuable—since \n","the alternative of investing in bonds has become relatively more attractive.\n","Rarely does one find a brokerage-house study that points out, \n","with a convincing array of facts, that a popular industry is head-\n","ing for a fall or that an unpopular one is due to prosper. Wall\n","Street’s view of the longer future is notoriously fallible, and this\n","necessarily applies to that important part of its investigations\n","which is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits in\n","various industries.\n","We must recognize, however, that the rapid and pervasive\n","growth of technology in recent years is not without major effect on\n","the attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than in\n","the past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the\n","coming decade may depend on its relation to new products and\n","new processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study and\n","evaluate in advance. Thus there is doubtless a promising area for\n","effective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with\n","research men, and on intensive technological investigation on his\n","own. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions\n","derived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup-\n","ported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhaps\n","equal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober\n","calculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it\n","both ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits that\n","are the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he\n","must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he\n","can be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premium\n","for possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-\n","pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.\n","A Two-Part Appraisal Process\n","Let us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal\n","of a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. A\n","great deal of reflection on the subject has led us to conclude that\n","this better be done quite differently than is now the established\n","practice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the\n","“past-performance value,” which is based solely on the past\n","record. This would indicate what the stock would be worth—\n","absolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIA or of the S & P compos-\n","ite—if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continue\n","Security Analysis for the Lay Investor\n","299\n","unchanged in the future. (This includes the assumption that its rel-\n","ative growth rate, as shown in the last seven years, will also con-\n","tinue unchanged over the next seven years.) This process could be\n","carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-\n","ual weights to past figures for profitability, stability, and growth,\n","and also for current financial condition. The second part of the\n","analysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on\n","past performance should be modified because of new conditions\n","expected in the future.\n","Such a procedure would divide the work between senior and\n","junior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up the\n","formula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-\n","performance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up such\n","factors for the designated companies—pretty much in mechanical\n","fashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to what\n","extent a company’s performance—absolute or relative—is likely to\n","differ from its past record, and what change should be made in \n","the value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the\n","senior analyst’s report showed both the original valuation and the\n","modified one, with his reasons for the change.\n","Is a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-\n","tive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.\n","We doubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently\n","dependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or\n","small. We shall illustrate the difficulties of this job in our discus-\n","sion of Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) in the next\n","chapter. Nonetheless it should be done for such common stocks.\n","Why? First, many security analysts are bound to make current or\n","projected valuations, as part of their daily work.

Thirdly, because\n","work of this kind could produce an invaluable body of recorded\n","experience—as has long been the case in medicine—that may lead\n","to better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-\n","sibilities and limitations. The public-utility stocks might well\n","prove an important area in which this approach will show real\n","pragmatic value.

The reduction from $5.20 to $5.01, to allow\n","for the effects of “dilution,” is clearly called for.

A stock with high trading volume is said to be “liquid.” When\n","a company goes public in an IPO, it “floats” its shares. And, in earlier days, a\n","company that drastically diluted its shares (with large amounts of convert-\n","ible debt or multiple offerings of common stock) was said to have “watered”\n","its stock. This term is believed to have originated with the legendary market\n","manipulator Daniel Drew (1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He\n","would drive his cattle south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt\n","along the way. When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge\n","volumes of water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market,\n","where the water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That\n","enabled him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by\n","the pound.

Accountants, likewise, can trans-\n","form simple financial facts into intricate and even incomprehensible patterns.\n","In dealing with ALCOA’s special charges, the first thing to\n","establish is how they arose. The footnotes are specific enough. The\n","deductions came from four sources, viz.:\n","1. Management’s estimate of the anticipated costs of closing\n","down the manufactured products division.\n","2. Ditto for closing down ALCOA Castings Co.’s plants.\n","3. Ditto for losses in phasing out ALCOA Credit Co.\n","4. Also, estimated costs of $5.3 million associated with comple-\n","tion of the contract for a “curtain wall.”\n","All of these items are related to future costs and losses. It is easy\n","to say that they are not part of the “regular operating results” of\n","1970—but if so, where do they belong? Are they so “extraordinary\n","and nonrecurring” as to belong nowhere? A widespread enterprise\n","such as ALCOA, doing a $1.5 billion business annually, must have\n","a lot of divisions, departments, affiliates, and the like. Would it not\n","be normal rather than extraordinary for one or more to prove\n","unprofitable, and to require closing down? Similarly for such\n","things as a contract to build a wall. Suppose that any time a com-\n","pany had a loss on any part of its business it had the bright idea of\n","charging it off as a “special item,” and thus reporting its “primary\n","earnings” per share so as to include only its profitable contracts\n","and operations? Like King Edward VII’s sundial, that marked only\n","the “sunny hours.”*\n","Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings\n","313\n","* The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay by the\n","English writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near Venice that\n","bore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas, or “I count only the hours\n","that are serene.” Companies that chronically exclude bad news from their\n","financial results on the pretext that negative events are “extraordinary” or\n","“nonrecurring” are taking a page from Hazlitt, who urged his readers “to\n","take no note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles and ne-\n","glect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and gentle moments,\n","turning away to the sunny side of things, and letting the rest slip from our\n","imaginations, unheeded or forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.\n","1827.) Unfortunately, investors must always count the sunny and dark hours\n","alike.\n","The reader should note two ingenious aspects of the ALCOA\n","procedure we have been discussing. The first is that by anticipating\n","future losses the company escapes the necessity of allocating the\n","losses themselves to an identifiable year. They don’t belong in\n","1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And they\n","won’t be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because\n","they have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it not\n","be just a little misleading?\n","The ALCOA footnote says nothing about the future tax saving\n","from these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-\n","cally that only the “after-tax effect” has been charged off.) If the\n","ALCOA figure represents future losses before the related tax credit,\n","then not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these\n","charges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increased by\n","a tax credit of some 50% thereof. It is difficult to believe that the\n","accounts will be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain com-\n","panies which have had large losses in the past have been able to\n","report future earnings without charging the normal taxes against\n","them, in that way making a very fine profits appearance indeed—\n","based paradoxically enough on their past disgraces. (Tax credits\n","resulting from past years’ losses are now being shown separately as\n","“special items,” but they will enter into future statistics as part of\n","the final “net-income” figure. However, a reserve now set up for\n","future losses, if net of expected tax credit, should not create an addi-\n","tion of this sort to the net income of later years.)\n","The other ingenious feature is the use by ALCOA and many\n","other companies of the 1970 year-end for making these special\n","charge-offs. The stock market took what appeared to be a blood\n","bath in the first half of 1970. Everyone expected relatively poor\n","results for the year for most companies. Wall Street was now antic-\n","ipating better results in 1971, 1972, etc. What a nice arrangement,\n","then, to charge as much as possible to the bad year, which had\n","already been written off mentally and had virtually receded into\n","the past, leaving the way clear for nicely fattened figures in the\n","next few years! Perhaps this is good accounting, good business pol-\n","icy, and good for management-shareholder relationships. But we\n","have lingering doubts.\n","The combination of widely (or should it be wildly?) diversified\n","operations with the impulse to clean house at the end of 1970 has\n","314\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","produced some strange-looking footnotes to the annual reports.\n","The reader may be amused by the following explanation given by \n","a New York Stock Exchange company (which shall remain\n","unnamed) of its “special items” aggregating $2,357,000, or about a\n","third of the income before charge-offs: “Consists of provision for\n","closing Spalding United Kingdom operations; provision for reorga-\n","nizational expenses of a division; costs of selling a small baby-\n","pants and bib manufacturing company, disposing of part interest\n","in a Spanish car-leasing facility, and liquidation of a ski-boot opera-\n","tion.”*\n","Years ago the strong companies used to set up “contingency\n","reserves” out of the profits of good years to absorb some of the bad\n","effects of depression years to come. The underlying idea was to\n","equalize the reported earnings, more or less, and to improve the\n","stability factor in the company’s record. A worthy motive, it would\n","seem; but the accountants quite rightly objected to the practice as\n","misstating the true earnings. They insisted that each year’s results\n","be presented as they were, good or bad, and the shareholders and\n","analysts be allowed to do the averaging or equalizing for them-\n","selves. We seem now to be witnessing the opposite phenomenon,\n","with everyone charging off as much as possible against forgotten\n","1970, so as to start 1971 with a slate not only clean but specially\n","prepared to show pleasing per-share figures in the coming years.\n","It is time to return to our first question. What then were the true\n","earnings of ALCOA in 1970? The accurate answer would be: The\n","$5.01 per share, after “dilution,” less that part of the 82 cents of\n","“special charges” that may properly be attributed to occurrences in\n","1970. But we do not know what that portion is, and hence we cannot\n","properly state the true earnings for the year. The management and the\n","auditors should have given us their best judgment on this point,\n","but they did not do so. And furthermore, the management and the\n","auditors should have provided for deduction of the balance of\n","these charges from the ordinary earnings of a suitable number of\n","Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings\n","315\n","* The company to which Graham refers so coyly appears to be American\n","Machine & Foundry (or AMF Corp.), one of the most jumbled conglomerates\n","of the late 1960s.

This evidently they will not\n","do either, since they have already conveniently disposed of the\n","entire sum as a 1970 special charge.\n","The more seriously investors take the per-share earnings figures\n","as published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard\n","against accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair\n","the true comparability of the numbers. We have mentioned three\n","sorts of these factors: the use of special charges, which may never be\n","reflected in the per-share earnings, the reduction in the normal\n","income-tax deduction by reason of past losses, and the dilution fac-\n","tor implicit in the existence of substantial amounts of convertible\n","securities or warrants.1 A fourth item that has had a significant\n","effect on reported earnings in the past is the method of treating\n","depreciation—chiefly as between the “straight-line” and the\n","“accelerated” schedules. We refrain from details here. But as an\n","example current as we write, let us mention the 1970 report of\n","Trane Co.

(The company will continue to use the accelerated rate on\n","its income-tax return, thus deferring income-tax payments on the\n","difference.)

We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary\n","that accompanies this chapter.\n","* Northwest Industries was the holding company for, among other busi-\n","nesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear\n","(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs). It was taken over in\n","1985 by overindebted financier William Farley, who ran the company into\n","the ground. Fruit of the Loom was bought in a bankruptcy proceeding by\n","Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in early 2002.\n","cant. If the transaction goes through, and if the tax laws are not\n","changed, this loss provided for in 1970 will permit Northwest\n","Industries to realize about $400 million of future profits (within\n","five years) from its other diversified interests without paying\n","income tax thereon.* What will then be the real earnings of that\n","enterprise; should they be calculated with or without provision for\n","the nearly 50% in income taxes which it will not actually have to\n","pay? In our opinion, the proper mode of calculation would be first\n","to consider the indicated earning power on the basis of full income-\n","tax liability, and to derive some broad idea of the stock’s value\n","based on that estimate. To this should be added some bonus figure,\n","representing the value per share of the important but temporary\n","tax exemption the company will enjoy. (Allowance must be made,\n","also, for a possible large-scale dilution in this case. Actually, the\n","convertible preferred issues and warrants would more than double\n","the outstanding common shares if the privileges are exercised.)\n","All this may be confusing and wearisome to our readers, but it\n","belongs in our story. Corporate accounting is often tricky; security\n","analysis can be complicated; stock valuations are really depend-\n","able only in exceptional cases.† For most investors it would be\n","probably best to assure themselves that they are getting good value\n","for the prices they pay, and let it go at that.\n","318\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that allows corpora-\n","tions to “carry forward” their net operating losses. As the tax code now\n","stands, these losses can be carried forward for up to 20 years, reducing the\n","company’s tax liability for the entire period (and thus raising its earnings\n","after tax). Therefore, investors should consider whether recent severe\n","losses could actually improve the company’s net earnings in the future.\n","† Investors should keep these words at hand and remind themselves of\n","them frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional\n","cases.” While the prices of most stocks are approximately right most of the\n","time, the price of a stock and the value of its business are almost never iden-\n","tical. The market’s judgment on price is often unreliable. Unfortunately, the\n","margin of the market’s pricing errors is often not wide enough to justify the\n","expense of trading on them. The intelligent investor must carefully evaluate\n","the costs of trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any\n","price discrepancy—and should never count on being able to sell for the\n","exact price currently quoted in the market.\n","Use of Average Earnings\n","In former times analysts and investors paid considerable atten-\n","tion to the average earnings over a fairly long period in the past—\n","usually from seven to ten years. This “mean figure”* was useful for\n","ironing out the frequent ups and downs of the business cycle, and\n","it was thought to give a better idea of the company’s earning\n","power than the results of the latest year alone. One important\n","advantage of such an averaging process is that it will solve the\n","problem of what to do about nearly all the special charges and\n","credits. They should be included in the average earnings. For cer-\n","tainly most of these losses and gains represent a part of the\n","company’s operating history. If we do this for ALCOA, the average\n","earnings for 1961–1970 (ten years) would appear as $3.62 and for\n","the seven years 1964–1970 as $4.62 per share. If such figures are\n","used in conjunction with ratings for growth and stability of earn-\n","ings during the same period, they could give a really informing\n","picture of the company’s past performance.\n","Calculation of the Past Growth Rate\n","It is of prime importance that the growth factor in a company’s\n","record be taken adequately into account. Where the growth has\n","been large the recent earnings will be well above the seven- or ten-\n","year average, and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrel-\n","evant. This need not be the case. The earnings can be given in\n","terms both of the average and the latest figure. We suggest that the\n","growth rate itself be calculated by comparing the average of the last\n","three years with corresponding figures ten years earlier. (Where\n","there is a problem of “special charges or credits” it may be dealt\n","with on some compromise basis.) Note the following calculation\n","for the growth of ALCOA as against that of Sears Roebuck and the\n","DJIA group as a whole.\n","Comment: These few figures could be made the subject of a long\n","discussion. They probably show as well as any others, derived by\n","elaborate mathematical treatment, the actual growth of earnings\n","Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings\n","319\n","* “Mean figure” refers to the simple, or arithmetic, average that Graham\n","describes in the preceding sentence.\n","for the long period 1958–1970. But how relevant is this figure, gen-\n","erally considered central in common-stock valuations, to the case\n","of ALCOA? Its past growth rate was excellent, actually a bit better\n","than that of acclaimed Sears Roebuck and much higher than that of\n","the DJIA composite. But the market price at the beginning of 1971\n","seemed to pay no attention to this fine performance. ALCOA sold\n","at only 111⁄2 times the recent three-year average, while Sears sold at\n","27 times and the DJIA itself at 15+ times. How did this come about?\n","Evidently Wall Street has fairly pessimistic views about the future\n","course of ALCOA’s earnings, in contrast with its past record. Sur-\n","prisingly enough, the high price for ALCOA was made as far back\n","as 1959. In that year it sold at 116, or 45 times its earnings. (This\n","compares with a 1959 adjusted high price of 251⁄2 for Sears Roebuck,\n","or 20 times its then earnings.) Even though ALCOA’s profits did\n","show excellent growth thereafter, it is evident that in this case the\n","future possibilities were greatly overestimated in the market price.\n","It closed 1970 at exactly half of the 1959 high, while Sears tripled in\n","price and the DJIA moved up nearly 30%.\n","It should be pointed out that ALCOA’s earnings on capital\n","funds* had been only average or less, and this may be the decisive\n","factor here.

Profitability. (a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings\n","on their book value, but the figures for Emerson and Emery are\n","much higher than for the other two. A high rate of return on\n","invested capital often goes along with a high annual growth rate in\n","earnings per share.* All the companies except Emery showed bet-\n","ter earnings on book value in 1969 than in 1961; but the Emery fig-\n","ure was exceptionally large in both years. (b) For manufacturing\n","companies, the profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indica-\n","tion of comparative strength or weakness. We use here the “ratio of\n","operating income to sales,” as given in Standard & Poor’s Listed\n","Stock Reports. Here again the results are satisfactory for all four\n","companies, with an especially impressive showing by Emerson.\n","The changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably among the\n","companies.\n","2. Stability. This we measure by the maximum decline in per-\n","share earnings in any one of the past ten years, as against the aver-\n","age of the three preceding years. No decline translates into 100%\n","stability, and this was registered by the two popular concerns. But\n","the shrinkages of eltra and Emhart were quite moderate in the\n","“poor year” 1970, amounting to only 8% each by our measurement,\n","against 7% for the DJIA.\n","3. Growth. The two low-multiplier companies show quite satis-\n","factory growth rates, in both cases doing better than the Dow Jones\n","group. The eltra figures are especially impressive when set\n","against its low price/earnings ratio. The growth is of course more\n","impressive for the high-multiplier pair.\n","4. Financial Position. The three manufacturing companies are in\n","sound financial condition, having better than the standard ratio of\n","$2 of current assets for $1 of current liabilities. Emery Air Freight\n","has a lower ratio; but it falls in a different category, and with its fine\n","record it would have no problem raising needed cash. All the com-\n","panies have relatively low long-term debt. “Dilution” note: Emer-\n","son Electric had $163 million of market value of low-dividend\n","A Comparison of Four Listed Companies\n","333\n","* This measure is captured in the line “Net per share/book value” in Table\n","13-2, which measures the companies’ net income as a percentage of their\n","tangible book value.\n","convertible preferred shares outstanding at the end of 1970. In \n","our analysis we have made allowance for the dilution factor in \n","the usual way by treating the preferred as if converted into com-\n","mon. This decreased recent earnings by about 10 cents per share, or\n","some 4%.\n","5. Dividends. What really counts is the history of continuance\n","without interruption. The best record here is Emhart’s, which has\n","not suspended a payment since 1902. eltra’s record is very good,\n","Emerson’s quite satisfactory, Emery Freight is a newcomer. The\n","variations in payout percentage do not seem especially significant.\n","The current dividend yield is twice as high on the “cheap pair” as\n","on the “dear pair,” corresponding to the price/earnings ratios.\n","6. Price History. The reader should be impressed by the percent-\n","age advance shown in the price of all four of these issues, as mea-\n","sured from the lowest to the highest points during the past 34\n","years. (In all cases the low price has been adjusted for subsequent\n","stock splits.) Note that for the DJIA the range from low to high was\n","on the order of 11 to 1; for our companies the spread has varied\n","from “only” 17 to 1 for Emhart to no less than 528 to 1 for Emery\n","Air Freight.* These manifold price advances are characteristic of\n","most of our older common-stock issues, and they proclaim the\n","great opportunities of profit that have existed in the stock markets\n","of the past. (But they may indicate also how overdone were the\n","declines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were\n","registered.) Both eltra and Emhart sustained price shrinkages of\n","more than 50% in the 1969–70 price break. Emerson and Emery had\n","serious, but less distressing, declines; the former rebounded to a\n","new all-time high before the end of 1970, the latter in early 1971.\n","334\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and dividing\n","the high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price. For example,\n","Emery’s high price of 66 divided by its low price of 1/8 equals 528, or a\n","ratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low.\n","General Observations on the Four Companies\n","Emerson Electric has an enormous total market value, dwarfing\n","the other three companies combined.* It is one of our “good-will\n","giants,” to be commented on later. A financial analyst blessed (or\n","handicapped) with a good memory will think of an analogy\n","between Emerson Electric and Zenith Radio, and that would not be\n","reassuring. For Zenith had a brilliant growth record for many\n","years; it too sold in the market for $1.7 billion (in 1966); but its prof-\n","its fell from $43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in\n","that year’s big selloff its price declined to 221⁄2 against the previous\n","top of 89. High valuations entail high risks.\n","Emery Air Freight must be the most promising of the four compa-\n","nies in terms of future growth, if the price/earnings ratio of nearly 40\n","times its highest reported earnings is to be even partially justified.\n","The past growth, of course, has been most impressive. But these fig-\n","ures may not be so significant for the future if we consider that they\n","started quite small, at only $570,000 of net earnings in 1958. It often\n","proves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after\n","volume and profits have already expanded to big totals. The most\n","surprising aspect of Emery’s story is that its earnings and market\n","price continued to grow apace in 1970, which was the worst year in\n","the domestic air-passenger industry. This is a remarkable achieve-\n","ment indeed, but it raises the question whether future profits may\n","not be vulnerable to adverse developments, through increased com-\n","petition, pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air-\n","lines, etc. An elaborate study might be needed before a sound\n","judgment could be passed on these points, but the conservative\n","investor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning.\n","Emhart and eltra. Emhart has done better in its business than in\n","the stock market over the past 14 years. In 1958 it sold as high as 22\n","times the current earnings—about the same ratio as for the DJIA.\n","Since then its profits tripled, as against a rise of less than 100% for\n","the Dow, but its closing price in 1970 was only a third above the\n","A Comparison of Four Listed Companies\n","335\n","* At the end of 1970, Emerson’s $1.6 billion in market value truly was “enor-\n","mous,” given average stock sizes at the time. At year-end 2002, Emerson’s\n","common stock had a total market value of approximately $21 billion.\n","1958 high, versus 43% for the Dow. The record of eltra is some-\n","what similar. It appears that neither of these companies possesses\n","glamour, or “sex appeal,” in the present market; but in all the sta-\n","tistical data they show up surprisingly well. Their future pros-\n","pects? We have no sage remarks to make here, but this is what\n","Standard & Poor’s had to say about the four companies in 1971:\n","eltra—“Long-term Prospects: Certain operations are cyclical, but an\n","established competitive position and diversification are offsetting fac-\n","tors.”\n","Emerson Electric—“While adequately priced (at 71) on the current\n","outlook, the shares have appeal for the long term. . . . A continued acqui-\n","sition policy together with a strong position in industrial fields and an\n","accelerated international program suggests further sales and earnings\n","progress.”\n","Emery Air Freight—“The shares appear amply priced (at 57) on cur-\n","rent prospects, but are well worth holding for the long pull.”\n","Emhart—“Although restricted this year by lower capital spending in\n","the glass-container industry, earnings should be aided by an improved\n","business environment in 1972. The shares are worth holding (at 34).”\n","Conclusions: Many financial analysts will find Emerson and\n","Emery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two—\n","primarily, perhaps, because of their better “market action,” and\n","secondarily because of their faster recent growth in earnings.\n","Under our principles of conservative investment the first is not a\n","valid reason for selection—that is something for the speculators to\n","play around with. The second has validity, but within limits. Can\n","the past growth and the presumably good prospects of Emery Air\n","Freight justify a price more than 60 times its recent earnings?1 Our\n","answer would be: Maybe for someone who has made an in-depth\n","study of the possibilities of this company and come up with excep-\n","tionally firm and optimistic conclusions. But not for the careful\n","investor who wants to be reasonably sure in advance that he is not\n","committing the typical Wall Street error of overenthusiasm for\n","good performance in earnings and in the stock market.* The same\n","336\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Graham was right. Of the “Nifty Fifty” stocks that were most fashionable\n","and highly valued in 1972, Emery fared among the worst. The March 1,\n","cautionary statements seem called for in the case of Emerson Elec-\n","tric, with a special reference to the market’s current valuation of\n","over a billion dollars for the intangible, or earning-power, factor\n","here. We should add that the “electronics industry,” once a fair-\n","haired child of the stock market, has in general fallen on disastrous\n","days. Emerson is an outstanding exception, but it will have to con-\n","tinue to be such an exception for a great many years in the future\n","before the 1970 closing price will have been fully justified by its\n","subsequent performance.\n","By contrast, both eltra at 27 and Emhart at 33 have the ear-\n","marks of companies with sufficient value behind their price to con-\n","stitute reasonably protected investments. Here the investor can, if\n","he wishes, consider himself basically a part owner of these busi-\n","nesses, at a cost corresponding to what the balance sheet shows to\n","be the money invested therein.* The rate of earnings on invested\n","capital has long been satisfactory; the stability of profits also; the\n","past growth rate surprisingly so. The two companies will meet our\n","seven statistical requirements for inclusion in a defensive investor’s\n","portfolio. These will be developed in the next chapter, but we sum-\n","marize them as follows:\n","1. Adequate size.\n","2. A sufficiently strong financial condition.\n","3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years.\n","4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years.\n","A Comparison of Four Listed Companies\n","337\n","1982, issue of Forbes reported that since 1972 Emery had lost 72.8% of its\n","value after inflation. By late 1974, according to the investment researchers\n","at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, Emery’s stock had already fallen 58%\n","and its price/earnings ratio had plummeted from 64 times to just 15. The\n","“overenthusiasm” Graham had warned against was eviscerated in short\n","order. Can the passage of time make up for this kind of excess? Not always:\n","Leuthold calculated that $1000 invested in Emery in 1972 would be worth\n","only $839 as of 1999. It’s likely that the people who overpaid for Internet\n","stocks in the late 1990s will not break even for decades—if ever (see the\n","commentary on Chapter 20).\n","* Graham’s point is that, based on their prices at the time, an investor could\n","buy shares in these two companies for little more than their book value, as\n","shown in the third line of Section B in Table 13-2.\n","5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings.\n","6. Price of stock no more than 11⁄2 times net asset value.\n","7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three\n","years.\n","We make no predictions about the future earnings performance\n","of eltra or Emhart. In the investor’s diversified list of common\n","stocks there are bound to be some that prove disappointing, and\n","this may be the case for one or both of this pair. But the diversified\n","list itself, based on the above principles of selection, plus whatever\n","other sensible criteria the investor may wish to apply, should per-\n","form well enough across the years. At least, long experience tells \n","us so.\n","A final observation: An experienced security analyst, even if he\n","accepted our general reasoning on these four companies, would\n","have hesitated to recommend that a holder of Emerson or Emery\n","exchange his shares for eltra or Emhart at the end of 1970—unless\n","the holder understood clearly the philosophy behind the recom-\n","mendation. There was no reason to expect that in any short period\n","of time the low-multiplier duo would outperform the high-\n","multipliers. The latter were well thought of in the market and thus\n","had a considerable degree of momentum behind them, which\n","might continue for an indefinite period. The sound basis for prefer-\n","ring eltra and Emhart to Emerson and Emery would be the\n","client’s considered conclusion that he preferred value-type invest-\n","ments to glamour-type investments. Thus, to a substantial extent,\n","common-stock investment policy must depend on the attitude of\n","the individual investor. This approach is treated at greater length\n","in our next chapter.\n","338\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 13\n","In the Air Force we have a rule: check six.

At year-end,\n","Emerson’s stock was priced at 17.7 times the company’s net income\n","per share. Like its power tools, Emerson was never flashy, but it was\n","reliable—and showed no sign of overheating.\n","C O U L D  E M C  G R O W  P D Q ?\n","EMC Corp. was one of the best-performing stocks of the 1990s, \n","rising—or should we say levitating?—more than 81,000%.

After all, over the previous five years, EMC had more\n","than doubled its revenues and better than tripled its net income.\n","But from 1995 through 1999, according to Value Line, EMC’s net\n","profit margin slid from 19.0% to 17.4%, while its return on capital\n","dropped from 26.8% to 21%. Although still highly profitable, EMC\n","was already slipping. And in October 1999, EMC acquired Data Gen-\n","eral Corp., which added roughly $1.1 billion to EMC’s revenues that\n","year. Simply by subtracting the extra revenues brought in from Data\n","General, we can see that the volume of EMC’s existing businesses\n","grew from $5.4 billion in 1998 to just $5.6 billion in 1999, a rise of\n","only 3.6%. In other words, EMC’s true growth rate was almost nil—\n","even in a year when the scare over the “Y2K” computer bug had led\n","many companies to spend record amounts on new technology.3\n","342\n","Commentary on Chapter 13\n","2 Appearing on CNBC on December 30, 1999, EMC’s chief executive,\n","Michael Ruettgers, was asked by host Ron Insana whether “2000 and\n","beyond” would be as good as the 1990s had been. “It actually looks like it’s\n","accelerating,” boasted Ruettgers. When Insana asked if EMC’s stock was\n","overvalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the opportunity\n","we have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited. . . . So while it’s hard to predict\n","whether these things are overpriced, there’s such a major change taking\n","place that if you could find the winners today—and I certainly think EMC is\n","one of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in the future.”\n","3 The “Y2K bug” or the “Year 2000 Problem” was the belief that millions of\n","computers worldwide would stop functioning at one second past midnight\n","A  S I M P L E  T W I S T  O F  F R E I G H T\n","Unlike EMC, Expeditors International hadn’t yet learned to levitate.\n","Although the firm’s shares had risen 30% annually in the 1990s, much\n","of that big gain had come at the very end, as the stock raced to a\n","109.1% return in 1999.

According to Value\n","Line, Expeditors’ book value per share had increased 129% and its\n","return on capital had risen by more than one-third to 21%.\n","By any standard, Expeditors was a superb business. But the little\n","freight-forwarding company, with its base in Seattle and much of its\n","operations in Asia, was all-but-unknown on Wall Street.

Since we have already described in general terms\n","the investment policies recommended for our two categories of\n","investors,* it would be logical for us now to indicate how security\n","analysis comes into play in order to implement these policies. The\n","defensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only\n","high-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks.\n","He is to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is\n","not unduly high as judged by applicable standards.\n","In setting up this diversified list he has a choice of two\n","approaches, the DJIA-type of portfolio and the quantitatively-\n","tested portfolio. In the first he acquires a true cross-section sample\n","of the leading issues, which will include both some favored growth\n","companies, whose shares sell at especially high multipliers, and\n","also less popular and less expensive enterprises. This could be\n","done, most simply perhaps, by buying the same amounts of all\n","thirty of the issues in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Ten\n","shares of each, at the 900 level for the average, would cost an\n","aggregate of about $16,000.1 On the basis of the past record he\n","might expect approximately the same future results by buying\n","shares of several representative investment funds.†\n","His second choice would be to apply a set of standards to each\n","347\n","* Graham describes his recommended investment policies in Chapters 4\n","through 7.\n","† As we have discussed in the commentaries on Chapters 5 and 9, today’s\n","defensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a low-cost index\n","fund, ideally one that tracks the return of the total U.S. stock market.\n","purchase, to make sure that he obtains (1) a minimum of quality in\n","the past performance and current financial position of the com-\n","pany, and also (2) a minimum of quantity in terms of earnings and\n","assets per dollar of price. At the close of the previous chapter we\n","listed seven such quality and quantity criteria suggested for the\n","selection of specific common stocks. Let us describe them in order.\n","1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise\n","All our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the\n","matter of size required. Our idea is to exclude small companies\n","which may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially\n","in the industrial field. (There are often good possibilities in such\n","enterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of the\n","defensive investor.) Let us use round amounts: not less than $100\n","million of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than\n","$50 million of total assets for a public utility.\n","2. A Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition\n","For industrial companies current assets should be at least twice\n","current liabilities—a so-called two-to-one current ratio. Also, long-\n","term debt should not exceed the net current assets (or “working\n","capital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the\n","stock equity (at book value).\n","3. Earnings Stability\n","Some earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten\n","years.\n","4. Dividend Record\n","Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.\n","5. Earnings Growth\n","A minimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings\n","in the past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning\n","and end.\n","348\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio\n","Current price should not be more than 15 times average earn-\n","ings of the past three years.\n","7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets\n","Current price should not be more than 11⁄2 times the book value last\n","reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a\n","correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we\n","suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to\n","book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15\n","times earnings and 11⁄2 times book value. It would admit an issue sell-\n","ing at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)\n","General Comments: These requirements are set up especially\n","for the needs and the temperament of defensive investors. They\n","will eliminate the great majority of common stocks as candidates\n","for the portfolio, and in two opposite ways. On the one hand they\n","will exclude companies that are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weak\n","financial condition, (3) with a deficit stigma in their ten-year\n","record, and (4) not having a long history of continuous dividends.\n","Of these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions are\n","those of financial strength. A considerable number of our large and\n","formerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur-\n","rent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years.\n","Our last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by\n","demanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than\n","the popular issues will supply. This is by no means the standard\n","viewpoint of financial analysts; in fact most will insist that even\n","conservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices\n","for stocks of the choice companies. We have expounded our con-\n","trary view above; it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac-\n","tor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on\n","ever-increasing earnings in the future. The reader will have to\n","decide this important question for himself—after weighing the\n","arguments on both sides.\n","We have nonetheless opted for the inclusion of a modest\n","requirement of growth over the past decade. Without it the typical\n","company would show retrogression, at least in terms of profit per\n","Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor\n","349\n","dollar of invested capital. There is no reason for the defensive\n","investor to include such companies—though if the price is low\n","enough they could qualify as bargain opportunities.\n","The suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well\n","result in a typical portfolio with an average multiplier of, say, 12 to\n","13 times. Note that in February 1972 American Tel. & Tel. sold at 11\n","times its three-year (and current) earnings, and Standard Oil of\n","California at less than 10 times latest earnings. Our basic recom-\n","mendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have\n","an overall earnings/price ratio—the reverse of the P/E ratio—at\n","least as high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean\n","a P/E ratio no higher than 13.3 against an AA bond yield of 7.5%.*\n","Application of Our Criteria to the DJIA at the End of 1970\n","All of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the DJIA issues at\n","the end of 1970, but two of them just barely. Here is a survey based\n","on the closing price of 1970 and the relevant figures. (The basic\n","data for each company are shown in Tables 14-1 and 14-2.)\n","1. Size is more than ample for each company.\n","2. Financial condition is adequate in the aggregate, but not for\n","every company.2\n","3. Some dividend has been paid by every company since at least\n","1940. Five of the dividend records go back to the last century.\n","350\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was around\n","4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio should have\n","an earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the inverse of that num-\n","ber (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a “suggested maximum” P/E\n","ratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this paragraph Graham recommends that\n","the “average” stock be priced about 20% below the “maximum” ratio. That\n","suggests that—in general—Graham would consider stocks selling at no more\n","than 17 times their three-year average earnings to be potentially attractive\n","given today’s interest rates and market conditions. As of December 31,\n","2002, more than 200—or better than 40%—of the stocks in the S & P 500-\n","stock index had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower.

Table 14-7 shows price changes between 1948 and 1970 in\n","six groups represented in the Standard & Poor’s stock-price\n","indexes. The average for 1941–1943 is taken as 10, the base level.\n","360\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Today the financial-services industry is made up of even more components,\n","including commercial banks; savings & loan and mortgage-financing compa-\n","nies; consumer-finance firms like credit-card issuers; money managers and\n","trust companies; investment banks and brokerages; insurance companies;\n","and firms engaged in developing or owning real estate, including real-estate\n","investment trusts. Although the sector is much more diversified today,\n","Graham’s caveats about financial soundness apply more than ever.\n","The year-end 1970 figures ranged between 44.3 for the 9 New York\n","banks and 218 for the 11 life-insurance stocks.

Some of the lines have managed to maintain their earn-\n","ing power and their dividends despite the general difficulties.\n","The Standard & Poor’s index advanced sevenfold from the low\n","of 1942 to the high of 1968, not much below the percentage gain in\n","the public-utility index. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central Trans-\n","portation Co., our most important railroad, in 1970 shocked the\n","financial world. Only a year and two years previously the stock\n","sold at close to the highest price level in its long history, and it had\n","paid continuous dividends for more than 120 years! (On p. 423\n","below we present a brief analysis of this railroad to illustrate how a\n","competent student could have detected the developing weaknesses\n","in the company’s picture and counseled against ownership of its\n","securities.) The market level of railroad shares as a whole was seri-\n","ously affected by this financial disaster.\n","It is usually unsound to make blanket recommendations of\n","whole classes of securities, and there are equal objections to broad\n","condemnations. The record of railroad share prices in Table 14-6\n","shows that the group as a whole has often offered chances for a\n","large profit.

The advice in this section is at\n","least as relevant to airline stocks today—with their massive current losses\n","and a half-century of almost incessantly poor results—as it was to railroads\n","in Graham’s day.\n","Selectivity for the Defensive Investor\n","Every investor would like his list to be better or more promising\n","than the average. Hence the reader will ask whether, if he gets him-\n","self a competent adviser or security analyst, he should not be able to\n","count on being supplied with an investment package of really supe-\n","rior merits. “After all,” he may say, “the rules you have outlined are\n","pretty simple and easygoing. A highly trained analyst ought to be\n","able to use all his skill and techniques to improve substantially on\n","something as obvious as the Dow Jones list. If not, what good are all\n","his statistics, calculations, and pontifical judgments?”\n","Suppose, as a practical test, we had asked a hundred security\n","analysts to choose the “best” five stocks in the Dow Jones Average,\n","to be bought at the end of 1970. Few would have come up with\n","identical choices and many of the lists would have differed com-\n","pletely from each other.\n","This is not so surprising as it may at first appear. The underlying\n","reason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well\n","reflects the salient factors in its financial record plus the general\n","opinion as to its future prospects. Hence the view of any analyst that\n","one stock is a better buy than the rest must arise to a great extent\n","from his personal partialities and expectations, or from the placing\n","of his emphasis on one set of factors rather than on another in his\n","work of evaluation. If all analysts were agreed that one particular\n","stock was better than all the rest, that issue would quickly advance\n","to a price which would offset all of its previous advantages.*\n","Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor\n","363\n","* Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH, an aca-\n","demic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates all publicly\n","available information about the company. With millions of investors scouring\n","the market every day, it is unlikely that severe mispricings can persist for\n","long. An old joke has two finance professors walking along the sidewalk;\n","when one spots a $20 bill and bends over to pick it up, the other grabs his\n","arm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was really a $20 bill, someone would have\n","taken it already.” While the market is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close\n","most of the time—so the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock\n","market’s $20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the\n","costs of trading and taxes.\n","Our statement that the current price reflects both known facts\n","and future expectations was intended to emphasize the double\n","basis for market valuations. Corresponding with these two kinds\n","of value elements are two basically different approaches to security\n","analysis. To be sure, every competent analyst looks forward to the\n","future rather than backward to the past, and he realizes that his\n","work will prove good or bad depending on what will happen and\n","not on what has happened. Nevertheless, the future itself can be\n","approached in two different ways, which may be called the way of\n","prediction (or projection) and the way of protection.*\n","Those who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate\n","fairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future\n","years—in particular whether earnings will show pronounced and\n","persistent growth. These conclusions may be based on a very care-\n","ful study of such factors as supply and demand in the industry—or\n","volume, price, and costs—or else they may be derived from a\n","rather naïve projection of the line of past growth into the future. If\n","these authorities are convinced that the fairly long-term prospects\n","are unusually favorable, they will almost always recommend the\n","stock for purchase without paying too much regard to the level at\n","which it is selling. Such, for example, was the general attitude with\n","respect to the air-transport stocks—an attitude that persisted for\n","many years despite the distressingly bad results often shown after\n","1946. In the Introduction we have commented on the disparity\n","between the strong price action and the relatively disappointing\n","earnings record of this industry.\n","364\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* This is one of the central points of Graham’s book. All investors labor\n","under a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for the future.\n","And, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain. Inflation and inter-\n","est rates are undependable; economic recessions come and go at random;\n","geopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages, and terrorism arrive\n","without warning; and the fate of individual companies and their industries\n","often turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect. Therefore,\n","investing on the basis of projection is a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of\n","the so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most peo-\n","ple, investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and\n","from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best solu-\n","tion. Graham expands on this concept in Chapter 20.\n","By contrast, those who emphasize protection are always espe-\n","cially concerned with the price of the issue at the time of study.\n","Their main effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of\n","indicated present value above the market price—which margin\n","could absorb unfavorable developments in the future. Generally\n","speaking, therefore, it is not so necessary for them to be enthusias-\n","tic over the company’s long-run prospects as it is to be reasonably\n","confident that the enterprise will get along.\n","The first, or predictive, approach could also be called the quali-\n","tative approach, since it emphasizes prospects, management, and\n","other nonmeasurable, albeit highly important, factors that go\n","under the heading of quality. The second, or protective, approach\n","may be called the quantitative or statistical approach, since it\n","emphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and\n","earnings, assets, dividends, and so forth. Incidentally, the quantita-\n","tive method is really an extension—into the field of common\n","stocks—of the viewpoint that security analysis has found to be\n","sound in the selection of bonds and preferred stocks for invest-\n","ment.\n","In our own attitude and professional work we were always\n","committed to the quantitative approach. From the first we wanted\n","to make sure that we were getting ample value for our money in\n","concrete, demonstrable terms. We were not willing to accept the\n","prospects and promises of the future as compensation for a lack of\n","sufficient value in hand. This has by no means been the standard\n","viewpoint among investment authorities; in fact, the majority\n","would probably subscribe to the view that prospects, quality of\n","management, other intangibles, and “the human factor” far out-\n","weigh the indications supplied by any study of the past record, the\n","balance sheet, and all the other cold figures.\n","Thus this matter of choosing the “best” stocks is at bottom a\n","highly controversial one. Our advice to the defensive investor is\n","that he let it alone. Let him emphasize diversification more than\n","individual selection. Incidentally, the universally accepted idea of\n","diversification is, in part at least, the negation of the ambitious pre-\n","tensions of selectivity. If one could select the best stocks unerringly,\n","one would only lose by diversifying. Yet within the limits of the\n","four most general rules of common-stock selection suggested for\n","the defensive investor (on pp. 114–115) there is room for a rather\n","considerable freedom of preference. At the worst the indulgence of\n","Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor\n","365\n","such preferences should do no harm; beyond that, it may add\n","something worthwhile to the results. With the increasing impact of\n","technological developments on long-term corporate results, the\n","investor cannot leave them out of his calculations. Here, as else-\n","where, he must seek a mean between neglect and overemphasis.\n","366\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 14\n","He that resteth upon gains certain, shall hardly grow to great\n","riches; and he that puts all upon adventures, doth oftentimes\n","break and come to poverty: it is good therefore to guard adven-\n","tures with certainties that may uphold losses.\n","—Sir Francis Bacon\n","G E T T I N G  S TA R T E D\n","How should you tackle the nitty-gritty work of stock selection?

Get yourself out of the stock-picking business and into an index fund,\n","where you belong.\n","CHAPTER 15\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","In the previous chapter we have dealt with common-stock selec-\n","tion in terms of broad groups of eligible securities, from which the\n","defensive investor is free to make up any list that he or his adviser\n","prefers, provided adequate diversification is achieved. Our empha-\n","sis in selection has been chiefly on exclusions—advising on the one\n","hand against all issues of recognizably poor quality, and on the\n","other against the highest-quality issues if their price is so high as to\n","involve a considerable speculative risk. In this chapter, addressed\n","to the enterprising investor, we must consider the possibilities and\n","the means of making individual selections which are likely to prove\n","more profitable than an across-the-board average.\n","What are the prospects of doing this successfully? We would be\n","less than frank, as the euphemism goes, if we did not at the outset\n","express some grave reservations on this score. At first blush the\n","case for successful selection appears self-evident. To get average\n","results—e.g., equivalent to the performance of the DJIA—should\n","require no special ability of any kind. All that is needed is a portfo-\n","lio identical with, or similar to, those thirty prominent issues.\n","Surely, then, by the exercise of even a moderate degree of skill—\n","derived from study, experience, and native ability—it should be\n","possible to obtain substantially better results than the DJIA.\n","Yet there is considerable and impressive evidence to the effect\n","that this is very hard to do, even though the qualifications of those\n","trying it are of the highest. The evidence lies in the record of the\n","numerous investment companies, or “funds,” which have been in\n","operation for many years. Most of these funds are large enough to\n","command the services of the best financial or security analysts in\n","the field, together with all the other constituents of an adequate\n","research department. Their expenses of operation, when spread\n","376\n","over their ample capital, average about one-half of 1% a year\n","thereon, or less. These costs are not negligible in themselves; but\n","when they are compared with the approximately 15% annual over-\n","all return on common stocks generally in the decade 1951–1960,\n","and even the 6% return in 1961–1970, they do not bulk large. A\n","small amount of superior selective ability should easily have over-\n","come that expense handicap and brought in a superior net result\n","for the fund shareholders.\n","Taken as a whole, however, the all-common-stock funds failed\n","over a long span of years to earn quite as good a return as was\n","shown on Standard & Poor’s 500-stock averages or the market as a\n","whole. This conclusion has been substantiated by several compre-\n","hensive studies. To quote the latest one before us, covering the\n","period 1960–1968:*\n","It appears from these results that random portfolios of New\n","York Stock Exchange stocks with equal investment in each stock\n","performed on the average better over the period than did mutual\n","funds in the same risk class. The differences were fairly substantial\n","for the low- and medium-risk portfolios (3.7% and 2.5% respec-\n","tively per annum), but quite small for the high-risk portfolios\n","(0.2% per annum).1\n","As we pointed out in Chapter 9, these comparative figures in no\n","way invalidate the usefulness of the investment funds as a finan-\n","cial institution. For they do make available to all members of the\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","377\n","* The Friend-Blume-Crockett research covered January 1960, through June\n","1968, and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual funds\n","against the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more than 500\n","of the largest stocks listed on the NYSE. The funds in the Friend-Blume-\n","Crockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had in the first half\n","of the measurement period, much as Graham found in his own research\n","(see above, pp. 158 and 229–232). But that improvement did not last. And\n","the thrust of these studies—that mutual funds, on average, underperform the\n","market by a margin roughly equal to their operating expenses and trading\n","costs—has been reconfirmed so many times that anyone who doubts them\n","should found a financial chapter of The Flat Earth Society.\n","investing public the possibility of obtaining approximately average\n","results on their common-stock commitments. For a variety of rea-\n","sons, most members of the public who put their money in common\n","stocks of their own choice fail to do nearly as well. But to the objec-\n","tive observer the failure of the funds to better the performance \n","of a broad average is a pretty conclusive indication that such an\n","achievement, instead of being easy, is in fact extremely difficult.\n","Why should this be so? We can think of two different explana-\n","tions, each of which may be partially applicable. The first is the\n","possibility that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current\n","prices not only all the important facts about the companies’ past\n","and current performance, but also whatever expectations can be\n","reasonably formed as to their future. If this is so, then the diverse\n","market movements which subsequently take place—and these are\n","often extreme—must be the result of new developments and prob-\n","abilities that could not be reliably foreseen. This would make the\n","price movements essentially fortuitous and random. To the extent\n","that the foregoing is true, the work of the security analyst—how-\n","ever intelligent and thorough—must be largely ineffective, because\n","in essence he is trying to predict the unpredictable.\n","The very multiplication of the number of security analysts may\n","have played an important part in bringing about this result. With\n","hundreds, even thousands, of experts studying the value factors\n","behind an important common stock, it would be natural to expect\n","that its current price would reflect pretty well the consensus of\n","informed opinion on its value. Those who would prefer it to other\n","issues would do so for reasons of personal partiality or optimism\n","that could just as well be wrong as right.\n","We have often thought of the analogy between the work of the\n","host of security analysts on Wall Street and the performance of\n","master bridge players at a duplicate-bridge tournament. The for-\n","mer try to pick the stocks “most likely to succeed”; the latter to get\n","top score for each hand played. Only a limited few can accomplish\n","either aim. To the extent that all the bridge players have about the\n","same level of expertness, the winners are likely to be determined\n","by “breaks” of various sorts rather than superior skill. On Wall\n","Street the leveling process is helped along by the freemasonry that\n","exists in the profession, under which ideas and discoveries are\n","quite freely shared at the numerous get-togethers of various sorts.\n","378\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","It is almost as if, at the analogous bridge tournament, the various\n","experts were looking over each other’s shoulders and arguing out\n","each hand as it was played.\n","The second possibility is of a quite different sort. Perhaps many\n","of the security analysts are handicapped by a flaw in their basic\n","approach to the problem of stock selection. They seek the indus-\n","tries with the best prospects of growth, and the companies in these\n","industries with the best management and other advantages. The\n","implication is that they will buy into such industries and such com-\n","panies at any price, however high, and they will avoid less promis-\n","ing industries and companies no matter how low the price of their\n","shares. This would be the only correct procedure if the earnings of\n","the good companies were sure to grow at a rapid rate indefinitely\n","in the future, for then in theory their value would be infinite. And\n","if the less promising companies were headed for extinction, with\n","no salvage, the analysts would be right to consider them unattrac-\n","tive at any price.\n","The truth about our corporate ventures is quite otherwise.\n","Extremely few companies have been able to show a high rate of\n","uninterrupted growth for long periods of time. Remarkably few,\n","also, of the larger companies suffer ultimate extinction. For most,\n","their history is one of vicissitudes, of ups and downs, of change in\n","their relative standing. In some the variations “from rags to riches\n","and back” have been repeated on almost a cyclical basis—the\n","phrase used to be a standard one applied to the steel industry—for\n","others spectacular changes have been identified with deterioration\n","or improvement of management.*\n","How does the foregoing inquiry apply to the enterprising\n","investor who would like to make individual selections that will\n","yield superior results? It suggests first of all that he is taking on a\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","379\n","* As we discuss in the commentary on Chapter 9, there are several other\n","reasons mutual funds have not been able to outperform the market aver-\n","ages, including the low returns on the funds’ cash balances and the high\n","costs of researching and trading stocks. Also, a fund holding 120 compa-\n","nies (a typical number) can trail the S & P 500-stock index if any of the other\n","380 companies in that benchmark turns out to be a great performer. The\n","fewer stocks a fund owns, the more likely it is to miss “the next Microsoft.”\n","difficult and perhaps impracticable assignment. Readers of this\n","book, however intelligent and knowing, could scarcely expect to\n","do a better job of portfolio selection than the top analysts of the\n","country. But if it is true that a fairly large segment of the stock mar-\n","ket is often discriminated against or entirely neglected in the stan-\n","dard analytical selections, then the intelligent investor may be in a\n","position to profit from the resultant undervaluations.\n","But to do so he must follow specific methods that are not gener-\n","ally accepted on Wall Street, since those that are so accepted do not\n","seem to produce the results everyone would like to achieve. It\n","would be rather strange if—with all the brains at work profession-\n","ally in the stock market—there could be approaches which are both\n","sound and relatively unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation\n","have been based on this unlikely fact.*\n","A Summary of the Graham-Newman Methods\n","To give concreteness to the last statement, it should be worth-\n","while to give a brief account of the types of operations we engaged\n","in during the thirty-year life of Graham-Newman Corporation,\n","between 1926 and 1956.† These were classified in our records as\n","follows:\n","Arbitrages: The purchase of a security and the simultaneous sale\n","380\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is summarizing the\n","Efficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the contrary, the prob-\n","lem with the stock market today is not that so many financial analysts are\n","idiots, but rather that so many of them are so smart. As more and more\n","smart people search the market for bargains, that very act of searching\n","makes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel paradox, makes the analysts look\n","as if they lack the intelligence to justify the search. The market’s valuation of\n","a given stock is the result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of col-\n","lective intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective intelli-\n","gence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does Graham’s\n","“Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of whack.\n","† Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved\n","it when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the suc-\n","cessor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account, which\n","he ran from January 1926, through December 1935.\n","of one or more other securities into which it was to be exchanged\n","under a plan of reorganization, merger, or the like.\n","Liquidations: Purchase of shares which were to receive one or\n","more cash payments in liquidation of the company’s assets.\n","Operations of these two classes were selected on the twin basis\n","of (a) a calculated annual return of 20% or more, and (b) our judg-\n","ment that the chance of a successful outcome was at least four out\n","of five.\n","Related Hedges: The purchase of convertible bonds or convertible\n","preferred shares, and the simultaneous sale of the common stock\n","into which they were exchangeable.

But a profit would be made if the common stock fell con-\n","siderably more than the senior issue, and the position closed out in\n","the market.\n","Net-Current-Asset (or “Bargain”) Issues: The idea here was to\n","acquire as many issues as possible at a cost for each of less than\n","their book value in terms of net-current-assets alone—i.e., giving\n","no value to the plant account and other assets. Our purchases were\n","made typically at two-thirds or less of such stripped-down asset\n","value.

The second were\n","“unrelated” hedging operations, in which the purchased security\n","was not exchangeable for the common shares sold.

Each of these classes gave us quite\n","consistently satisfactory results from then on, with the special fea-\n","ture that the related hedges turned in good profits in the bear mar-\n","kets when our “undervalued issues” were not doing so well.\n","We hesitate to prescribe our own diet for any large number of\n","intelligent investors. Obviously, the professional techniques we\n","have followed are not suitable for the defensive investor, who by\n","definition is an amateur. As for the aggressive investor, perhaps\n","only a small minority of them would have the type of temperament\n","needed to limit themselves so severely to only a relatively small\n","part of the world of securities. Most active-minded practitioners\n","would prefer to venture into wider channels. Their natural hunting\n","grounds would be the entire field of securities that they felt (a)\n","were certainly not overvalued by conservative measures, and (b)\n","appeared decidedly more attractive—because of their prospects or\n","past record, or both—than the average common stock. In such\n","choices they would do well to apply various tests of quality and\n","price-reasonableness along the lines we have proposed for the\n","defensive investor. But they should be less inflexible, permitting a\n","considerable plus in one factor to offset a small black mark in\n","another. For example, he might not rule out a company which had\n","shown a deficit in a year such as 1970, if large average earnings and\n","other important attributes made the stock look cheap.

(This fact is not truly important; it would\n","probably—not necessarily—warn defensive investors against such\n","a list, but the inference for enterprising investors might be favor-\n","able on balance.)* Before making a further scrutiny let us calculate\n","some numbers. Our list represents about one in ten of the first 200\n","issues looked at. On that basis the Guide should yield, say, 450\n","issues selling at multipliers under 10. This would make a goodly\n","number of candidates for further selectivity.\n","So let us apply to our list some additional criteria, rather similar\n","to those we suggested for the defensive investor, but not so severe.\n","We suggest the following:\n","1. Financial condition: (a) Current assets at least 11⁄2 times current\n","liabilities, and (b) debt not more than 110% of net current assets\n","(for industrial companies).\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","385\n","* For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around $1 per share—the\n","level below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared ineligible for trad-\n","ing on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock prices of these companies\n","can take a considerable amount of effort, making them impractical for defen-\n","sive investors. The costs of trading low-priced stocks can be very high.\n","Finally, companies with very low stock prices have a distressing tendency to\n","go out of business. However, a diversified portfolio of dozens of these dis-\n","tressed companies may still appeal to some enterprising investors today.\n","2. Earnings stability: No deficit in the last five years covered in\n","the Stock Guide.\n","3. Dividend record: Some current dividend.\n","4. Earnings growth: Last year’s earnings more than those of 1966.\n","5. Price: Less than 120% net tangible assets.\n","The earnings figures in the Guide were generally for those end-\n","ing September 30, 1970, and thus do not include what may be a bad\n","quarter at the end of that year. But an intelligent investor can’t ask\n","for the moon—at least not to start with. Note also that we set no\n","lower limit on the size of the enterprise.

(They are set forth in\n","Table 15–1, together with some relevant data.) The group, of\n","course, is presented for illustration only, and would not necessarily\n","have been chosen by our inquiring investor.\n","The fact is that the user of our method would have had a much\n","wider choice. If our winnowing approach had been applied to all\n","4,500 companies in the Stock Guide, and if the ratio for the first\n","tenth had held good throughout, we would end up with about 150\n","companies meeting all six of our criteria of selection.

(2) A high\n","dividend return. (3) A very long dividend record. (4) A very large\n","enterprise, as measured by number of outstanding shares. (5) A\n","strong financial position. (6) A low price in dollars per share. (7) A\n","low price in relation to the previous high price. (8) A high quality-\n","ranking by Standard & Poor’s.\n","It will be noted that the Stock Guide has at least one column relat-\n","ing to each of the above criteria. This indicates the publisher’s\n","belief that each is of importance in analyzing and choosing com-\n","mon stocks. (As we pointed out above, we should like to see\n","another figure added: the net-asset-value per share.)\n","The most important fact that emerges from our various tests\n","relates to the performance of stocks bought at random. We have\n","tested this performance for three 30-stock portfolios, each made up\n","of issues found on the first line of the December 31, 1968, Stock\n","Guide and also found in the issue for August 31, 1971. Between\n","these two dates the S & P composite was practically unchanged,\n","and the DJIA lost about 5%. But our 90 randomly chosen issues\n","declined an average of 22%, not counting 19 issues that were\n","dropped from the Guide and probably showed larger losses. These\n","comparative results undoubtedly reflect the tendency of smaller\n","issues of inferior quality to be relatively overvalued in bull mar-\n","kets, and not only to suffer more serious declines than the stronger\n","issues in the ensuing price collapse, but also to delay their full\n","recovery—in many cases indefinitely. The moral for the intelligent\n","388\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","investor is, of course, to avoid second-quality issues in making up\n","a portfolio, unless—for the enterprising investor—they are demon-\n","strable bargains.\n","Other results gleaned from our portfolio studies may be sum-\n","marized as follows:\n","Only three of the groups studied showed up better than the \n","S & P composite (and hence better than the DJIA), viz: (1) Industri-\n","als with the highest quality ranking (A+). These advanced 91⁄2% in\n","the period against a decline of 2.4% for the S & P industrials, and\n","5.6% for the DJIA. (However, the ten public-utility issues rated A+\n","declined 18% against a decline of 14% for the 55-stock S & P public-\n","utility index.) It is worth remarking that the S & P rankings showed\n","up very well in this single test. In every case a portfolio based on a\n","higher ranking did better than a lower-ranking portfolio. (2) Com-\n","panies with more than 50 million shares outstanding showed no\n","change on the whole, as against a small decline for the indexes. (3)\n","Strangely enough, stocks selling at a high price per share (over 100)\n","showed a slight (1%) composite advance.\n","Among our various tests we made one based on book value, a\n","figure not given in the Stock Guide. Here we found—contrary to our\n","investment philosophy—that companies that combined major size\n","with a large good-will component in their market price did very\n","well as a whole in the 21⁄2-year holding period. (By “good-will com-\n","ponent” we mean the part of the price that exceeds the book\n","value.)* Our list of “good-will giants” was made up of 30 issues,\n","each of which had a good-will component of over a billion dollars,\n","representing more than half of its market price. The total market\n","value of these good-will items at the end of 1968 was more than\n","$120 billions! Despite these optimistic market valuations the group\n","as a whole showed a price advance per share of 15% between\n","December 1968 and August 1971, and acquitted itself best among\n","the 20-odd lists studied.\n","A fact like this must not be ignored in a work on investment\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","389\n","* In Graham’s terms, a large amount of goodwill can result from two causes:\n","a corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more than the\n","value of their assets, or its own stock can trade for substantially more than\n","its book value.\n","policies. It is clear that, at the least, a considerable momentum is\n","attached to those companies that combine the virtues of great size,\n","an excellent past record of earnings, the public’s expectation of\n","continued earnings growth in the future, and strong market action\n","over many past years. Even if the price may appear excessive by\n","our quantitative standards the underlying market momentum may\n","well carry such issues along more or less indefinitely. (Naturally\n","this assumption does not apply to every individual issue in the cat-\n","egory. For example, the indisputable good-will leader, IBM, moved\n","down from 315 to 304 in the 30-month period.) It is difficult to\n","judge to what extent the superior market action shown is due to\n","“true” or objective investment merits and to what extent to long-\n","established popularity. No doubt both factors are important here.\n","Clearly, both the long-term and the recent market action of the\n","good-will giants would recommend them for a diversified portfo-\n","lio of common stocks. Our own preference, however, remains for\n","other types that show a combination of favorable investment fac-\n","tors, including asset values of at least two-thirds the market price.\n","The tests using other criteria indicate in general that random\n","lists based on a single favorable factor did better than random lists\n","chosen for the opposite factor—e.g., low-multiplier issues had a\n","smaller decline in this period than high-multiplier issues, and\n","long-term dividend payers lost less than those that were not pay-\n","ing dividends at the end of 1968. To that extent the results support\n","our recommendation that the issues selected meet a combination of\n","quantitative or tangible criteria.\n","Finally we should comment on the much poorer showing made\n","by our lists as a whole as compared with the price record of the \n","S & P composite. The latter is weighted by the size of each enter-\n","prise, whereas our tests are based on taking one share of each com-\n","pany. Evidently the larger emphasis given to giant enterprises by\n","the S & P method made a significant difference in the results, and\n","points up once again their greater price stability as compared with\n","“run-of-the-mine” companies.\n","Bargain Issues, or Net-Current-Asset Stocks\n","In the tests discussed above we did not include the results of buy-\n","ing 30 issues at a price less than their net-current-asset value. The rea-\n","son was that only a handful, at most, of such issues would have been\n","390\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","found in the Stock Guide at the end of 1968. But the picture changed in\n","the 1970 decline, and at the low prices of that year a goodly number\n","of common stocks could have been bought at below their working-\n","capital value. It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple\n","to say that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at\n","a price less than the applicable net current assets alone—after deduct-\n","ing all prior claims, and counting as zero the fixed and other assets—\n","the results should be quite satisfactory. They were so, in our\n","experience, for more than 30 years—say, between 1923 and 1957—\n","excluding a time of real trial in 1930–1932.\n","Has this approach any relevance at the beginning of 1971? Our\n","answer would be a qualified “yes.” A quick runover of the Stock\n","Guide would have uncovered some 50 or more issues that appeared\n","to be obtainable at or below net-current-asset value. As might be\n","expected a good many of these had been doing badly in the diffi-\n","cult year 1970.

It\n","was commented upon above. Here we shall supply some examples\n","of the genre, and some further remarks on what it appears to offer\n","an open-minded and alert investor.\n","Three such situations, among others, were current early in 1971,\n","and they may be summarized as follows:\n","Situation 1. Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Borden’s. In January\n","1971 Borden Inc. announced a plan to acquire control of Kayser-\n","Roth (“diversified apparel”) by giving 11⁄3 shares of its own stock in\n","exchange for one share of Kayser-Roth. On the following day, in\n","active trading. Borden closed at 26 and Kayser-Roth at 28. If an\n","“operator” had bought 300 shares of Kayser-Roth and sold 400 Bor-\n","den at these prices and if the deal were later consummated on the\n","announced terms, he would have had a profit of some 24% on the\n","cost of his shares, less commissions and some other items. Assum-\n","ing the deal had gone through in six months, his final profit might\n","have been at about a 40% per annum rate.\n","Situation 2. In November 1970 National Biscuit Co. offered to\n","buy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at $11 in cash. The stock was sell-\n","ing at about 81⁄2; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at\n","year-end. Here the gross profit indicated was originally about 25%,\n","subject to the risks of nonconsummation and to the time element.\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","393\n","Situation 3. Universal-Marion Co., which had ceased its business\n","operations, asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern.\n","The treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of\n","about $281⁄2 per share, a substantial part of which was in liquid form.\n","The stock closed 1970 at 211⁄2, indicating a possible gross profit here, if\n","book value was realized in liquidation, of more than 30%.\n","If operations of this kind, conducted on a diversified basis for\n","spreading the risk, could be counted to yield annual profits of, say,\n","20% or better, they would undoubtedly be more than merely\n","worthwhile. Since this is not a book on “special situations,” we are\n","not going into the details of the business—for it really is a business.\n","Let us point out two contradictory developments there in recent\n","years. On the one hand the number of deals to choose from has\n","increased enormously, as compared with, say, ten years ago. This is\n","a consequence of what might be called a mania of corporations to\n","diversify their activities through various types of acquisitions, etc.\n","In 1970 the number of “merger announcements” aggregated some\n","5,000, down from over 6,000 in 1969. The total money values\n","involved in these deals amounted to many, many billions. Perhaps\n","only a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could have pre-\n","sented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special-\n","situations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep him\n","busy studying, picking, and choosing.\n","The other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of\n","the mergers announced failed to be consummated. In such cases, of\n","course, the aimed-for profit is not realized, and is likely to be\n","replaced by a more or less serious loss. Reasons for nonsuccess are\n","numerous, including antitrust intervention, shareholder opposi-\n","tion, change in “market conditions,” unfavorable indications from\n","further study, inability to agree on details, and others. The trick\n","here, of course, is to have the judgment, buttressed by experience,\n","to pick the deals most likely to succeed and also those which are\n","likely to occasion the smallest loss if they fail.*\n","394\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7, merger arbitrage is wholly\n","inappropriate for most individual investors.\n","Further Comment on the Examples Above\n","Kayser-Roth. The directors of this company had already\n","rejected (in January 1971) the Borden proposal when this chapter\n","was written. If the operation had been “undone” immediately the\n","overall loss, including commissions, would have been about 12%\n","of the cost of the Kayser-Roth shares.\n","Aurora Plastics. Because of the bad showing of this company\n","in 1970 the takeover terms were renegotiated and the price reduced\n","to 101⁄2. The shares were paid for at the end of May. The annual rate\n","of return realized here was about 25%.\n","Universal-Marion. This company promptly made an initial\n","distribution in cash and stock worth about $7 per share, reducing\n","the investment to say 141⁄2. However the market price fell as low as\n","13 subsequently, casting doubt on the ultimate outcome of the liq-\n","uidation.\n","Assuming that the three examples given are fairly representa-\n","tive of “workout or arbitrage” opportunities as a whole in 1971, it\n","is clear that they are not attractive if entered into upon a random\n","basis. This has become more than ever a field for professionals,\n","with the requisite experience and judgment.\n","There is an interesting sidelight on our Kayser-Roth example.\n","Late in 1971 the price fell below 20 while Borden was selling at 25,\n","equivalent to 33 for Kayser-Roth under the terms of the exchange\n","offer. It would appear that either the directors had made a great\n","mistake in turning down that opportunity or the shares of Kayser-\n","Roth were now badly undervalued in the market. Something for a\n","security analyst to look into.\n","Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","395\n","COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 15\n","It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy\n","in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in\n","the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the inde-\n","pendence of solitude.\n","—Ralph Waldo Emerson\n","P R A C T I C E ,  P R A C T I C E ,  P R A C T I C E\n","Max Heine, founder of the Mutual Series Funds, liked to say that\n","“there are many roads to Jerusalem.” What this masterly stock picker\n","meant was that his own value-centered method of selecting stocks\n","was not the only way to be a successful investor. In this chapter we’ll\n","look at several techniques that some of today’s leading money man-\n","agers use for picking stocks.\n","First, though, it’s worth repeating that for most investors, selecting\n","individual stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. The fact that most\n","professionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean that most\n","amateurs can do better. The vast majority of people who try to pick\n","stocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought; the lucki-\n","est ones discover this early on, while the less fortunate take years to\n","learn it. A small percentage of investors can excel at picking their own\n","stocks. Everyone else would be better off getting help, ideally through\n","an index fund.\n","Graham advised investors to practice first, just as even the greatest\n","athletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual per-\n","formance. He suggested starting off by spending a year tracking and\n","picking stocks (but not with real money).1 In Graham’s day, you would\n","396\n","1 Patricia Dreyfus, “Investment Analysis in Two Easy Lessons” (interview\n","with Graham), Money, July, 1976, p. 36.\n","have practiced using a ledger of hypothetical buys and sells on a \n","legal pad; nowadays, you can use “portfolio trackers” at websites like\n","www.morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com, http://money.cnn.\n","com/services/portfolio/ or www.marketocracy.com (at the last site,\n","ignore the “market-beating” hype on its funds and other services).\n","By test-driving your techniques before trying them with real money,\n","you can make mistakes without incurring any actual losses, develop\n","the discipline to avoid frequent trading, compare your approach\n","against those of leading money managers, and learn what works for\n","you. Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-\n","vent you from forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to be\n","stinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners and your losers.\n","After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if\n","you had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund. If you didn’t\n","enjoy the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selecting\n","individual stocks is not for you. Get yourself an index fund and stop\n","wasting your time on stock picking.\n","If you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns,\n","gradually assemble a basket of stocks—but limit it to a maximum of\n","10% of your overall portfolio (keep the rest in an index fund). And\n","remember, you can always stop if it no longer interests you or your\n","returns turn bad.\n","L O O K I N G  U N D E R  T H E  R I G H T  R O C K S\n","So how should you go about looking for a potentially rewarding\n","stock? You can use websites like http://finance.yahoo.com and\n","www.morningstar.com to screen stocks with the statistical filters sug-\n","gested in Chapter 14.

Christopher Davis of the\n","Davis Funds defines it with this formula:\n","ROIC = Owner Earnings \u0003 Invested Capital,\n","where Owner Earnings is equal to:\n","Operating profit\n","plus depreciation\n","plus amortization of goodwill\n","minus Federal income tax (paid at the company’s average rate)\n","minus cost of stock options\n","minus “maintenance” (or essential) capital expenditures\n","minus any income generated by unsustainable rates of return on\n","pension funds (as of 2003, anything greater than 6.5%)\n","and where Invested Capital is equal to:\n","Total assets\n","minus cash (as well as short-term investments and non-interest-\n","bearing current liabilities)\n","plus past accounting charges that reduced invested capital.\n","ROIC has the virtue of showing, after all legitimate expenses,\n","what the company earns from its operating businesses—and\n","how efficiently it has used the shareholders’ money to generate\n","that return.

Probably\n","no other investor, Graham included, has publicly revealed more\n","about his approach or written such compellingly readable\n","essays. (One classic Buffett proverb: “When a management\n","with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputa-\n","tion for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that\n","remains intact.”) Every intelligent investor can—and should—learn\n","by reading this master’s own words.\n","have in common; by reading the managers’ commentary, you may get\n","ideas on how to improve your own approach.3\n","No matter which techniques they use in picking stocks, successful\n","investing professionals have two things in common: First, they are dis-\n","ciplined and consistent, refusing to change their approach even when\n","it is unfashionable.

As a parallel development, stock-option warrants—\n","which are long-term rights to buy common shares at stipulated\n","prices—have become more and more numerous. More than half\n","the preferred issues now quoted in the Standard & Poor’s Stock\n","Guide have conversion privileges, and this has been true also of a\n","major part of the corporate bond financing in 1968–1970. There are\n","at least 60 different series of stock-option warrants dealt in on the\n","American Stock Exchange. In 1970, for the first time in its history,\n","the New York Stock Exchange listed an issue of long-term war-\n","rants, giving rights to buy 31,400,000 American Tel. & Tel. shares at\n","$52 each. With “Mother Bell” now leading that procession, it is\n","bound to be augmented by many new fabricators of warrants. (As\n","we shall point out later, they are a fabrication in more than one\n","sense.)*\n","In the overall picture the convertible issues rank as much more\n","important than the warrants, and we shall discuss them first. There\n","are two main aspects to be considered from the standpoint of the\n","investor. First, how do they rank as investment opportunities and\n","risks? Second, how does their existence affect the value of the\n","related common-stock issues?\n","Convertible issues are claimed to be especially advantageous to\n","both the investor and the issuing corporation. The investor receives\n","the superior protection of a bond or preferred stock, plus the\n","opportunity to participate in any substantial rise in the value of the\n","403\n","* Graham detested warrants, as he makes clear on pp. 413–416.\n","common stock. The issuer is able to raise capital at a moderate\n","interest or preferred dividend cost, and if the expected prosperity\n","materializes the issuer will get rid of the senior obligation by hav-\n","ing it exchanged into common stock. Thus both sides to the bargain\n","will fare unusually well.\n","Obviously the foregoing paragraph must overstate the case\n","somewhere, for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bar-\n","gain much better for both sides. In exchange for the conversion\n","privilege the investor usually gives up something important in\n","quality or yield, or both.1 Conversely, if the company gets its\n","money at lower cost because of the conversion feature, it is surren-\n","dering in return part of the common shareholders’ claim to future\n","enhancement. On this subject there are a number of tricky argu-\n","ments to be advanced both pro and con. The safest conclusion that\n","can be reached is that convertible issues are like any other form of\n","security, in that their form itself guarantees neither attractiveness\n","nor unattractiveness. That question will depend on all the facts\n","surrounding the individual issue.*\n","We do know, however, that the group of convertible issues\n","floated during the latter part of a bull market are bound to yield\n","unsatisfactory results as a whole. (It is at such optimistic periods,\n","unfortunately, that most of the convertible financing has been done\n","in the past.) The poor consequences must be inevitable, from the\n","timing itself, since a wide decline in the stock market must invari-\n","ably make the conversion privilege much less attractive—and\n","often, also, call into question the underlying safety of the issue\n","itself.† As a group illustration we shall retain the example used in\n","404\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric that investors\n","usually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically offer “the best of both\n","worlds.” Higher yield and lower risk do not always go hand in hand. What\n","Wall Street gives with one hand, it usually takes away with the other. An\n","investment may offer the best of one world, or the worst of another; but the\n","best of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package.\n","† According to Goldman Sachs and Ibbotson Associates, from 1998\n","through 2002, convertibles generated an average annual return of 4.8%.\n","That was considerably better than the 0.6% annual loss on U.S. stocks, but\n","substantially worse than the returns of medium-term corporate bonds (a\n","our first edition of the relative price behavior of convertible and\n","straight (nonconvertible) preferreds offered in 1946, the closing\n","year of the bull market preceding the extraordinary one that began\n","in 1949.\n","A comparable presentation is difficult to make for the years\n","1967–1970, because there were virtually no new offerings of non-\n","convertibles in those years. But it is easy to demonstrate that the\n","average price decline of convertible preferred stocks from Decem-\n","ber 1967 to December 1970 was greater than that for common\n","stocks as a whole (which lost only 5%). Also the convertibles seem\n","to have done quite a bit worse than the older straight preferred\n","shares during the period December 1968 to December 1970, as is\n","shown by the sample of 20 issues of each kind in Table 16-2.

In 2000, $58 billion in convertibles were issued, and in 2001,\n","another $105 billion emerged. As Graham warns, convertible securities\n","always come out of the woodwork near the end of a bull market—largely\n","because even poor-quality companies then have stock returns high enough\n","to make the conversion feature seem attractive.\n","TABLE 16-1\n","Price Record of New Preferred-Stock Issues\n","Offered in 1946\n","No decline\n","7\n","0\n","Declined 0–10%\n","16\n","2\n","10–20%\n","11\n","6\n","20–40%\n","3\n","22\n","40% or more\n","0\n","12\n","37\n","42\n","Average decline\n","About 9%\n","About 30%\n","Price Change from Issue Price \n","to Low up to July 1947\n","“Straight”\n","Issues\n","Convertible and\n","Participating\n","Issues\n","(number of issues)\n","comparisons would demonstrate that convertible securities as a\n","whole have relatively poor quality as senior issues and also are tied\n","to common stocks that do worse than the general market except\n","during a speculative upsurge.

We\n","believe it still merits inclusion here. Like several of our references it\n","is based on our own investment operations. We were members of a\n","“select group,” mainly of investment funds, who participated in a\n","private offering of convertible 41⁄2% debentures of Eversharp Co. at\n","par, convertible into common stock at $40 per share. The stock\n","advanced rapidly to 651⁄2, and then (after a three-for-two split) to the\n","equivalent of 88. The latter price made the convertible debentures\n","worth no less than 220. During this period the two issues were\n","called at a small premium; hence they were practically all converted\n","into common stock, which was retained by a number of the original\n","investment-fund buyers of the debentures. The price promptly\n","began a severe decline, and in March 1948 the stock sold as low as\n","73⁄8. This represented a value of only 27 for the debenture issues, or a\n","loss of 75% of the original price instead of a profit of over 100%.\n","The real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers\n","converted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its\n","great decline. In so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of Wall\n","Street, which runs: “Never convert a convertible bond.” Why this\n","advice? Because once you convert you have lost your strategic com-\n","bination of prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive\n","profit. You have probably turned from investor into speculator, and\n","quite often at an unpropitious time (because the stock has already\n","had a large advance). If “Never convert a convertible” is a good\n","rule, how came it that these experienced fund managers exchanged\n","their Eversharp bonds for stock, to their subsequent embarrassing\n","loss? The answer, no doubt, is that they let themselves be carried\n","away by enthusiasm for the company’s prospects as well as by the\n","“favorable market action” of the shares. Wall Street has a few pru-\n","dent principles; the trouble is that they are always forgotten when\n","they are most needed.* Hence that other famous dictum of the old-\n","timers: “Do as I say, not as I do.”\n","Our general attitude toward new convertible issues is thus a\n","mistrustful one. We mean here, as in other similar observations,\n","Convertible Issues and Warrants\n","409\n","* This sentence could serve as the epitaph for the bull market of the 1990s.\n","Among the “few prudent principles” that investors forgot were such market\n","clichés as “Trees don’t grow to the sky” and “Bulls make money, bears make\n","money, but pigs get slaughtered.”\n","that the investor should look more than twice before he buys them.\n","After such hostile scrutiny he may find some exceptional offerings\n","that are too good to refuse. The ideal combination, of course, is a\n","strongly secured convertible, exchangeable for a common stock\n","which itself is attractive, and at a price only slightly higher than the\n","current market. Every now and then a new offering appears that\n","meets these requirements. By the nature of the securities markets,\n","however, you are more likely to find such an opportunity in some\n","older issue which has developed into a favorable position rather\n","than in a new flotation. (If a new issue is a really strong one, it is\n","not likely to have a good conversion privilege.)\n","The fine balance between what is given and what is withheld in\n","a standard-type convertible issue is well illustrated by the exten-\n","sive use of this type of security in the financing of American Tele-\n","phone & Telegraph Company. Between 1913 and 1957 the company\n","sold at least nine separate issues of convertible bonds, most of\n","them through subscription rights to shareholders. The convertible\n","bonds had the important advantage to the company of bringing in\n","a much wider class of buyers than would have been available for a\n","stock offering, since the bonds were popular with many financial\n","institutions which possess huge resources but some of which were\n","not permitted to buy stocks. The interest return on the bonds has\n","generally been less than half the corresponding dividend yield on\n","the stock—a factor that was calculated to offset the prior claim of\n","the bondholders. Since the company maintained its $9 dividend\n","rate for 40 years (from 1919 to the stock split in 1959) the result was\n","the eventual conversion of virtually all the convertible issues into\n","common stock. Thus the buyers of these convertibles have fared\n","well through the years—but not quite so well as if they had bought\n","the capital stock in the first place. This example establishes the\n","soundness of American Telephone & Telegraph, but not the intrin-\n","sic attractiveness of convertible bonds. To prove them sound in\n","practice we should need to have a number of instances in which\n","the convertible worked out well even though the common stock\n","proved disappointing. Such instances are not easy to find.*\n","410\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* AT&T Corp. no longer is a significant issuer of convertible bonds.

Perhaps the most strik-\n","ing example of this financial operation was the issuance by the\n","NVF Corp. of nearly $100,000,000 of its 5% convertible bonds (plus\n","warrants) in exchange for most of the common stock of Sharon\n","Steel Co. This extraordinary deal is discussed below pp. 429–433.\n","Typically the transaction results in a pro forma increase in the\n","reported earnings per share of common stock; the shares advance\n","in response to their larger earnings, so-called, but also because the\n","management has given evidence of its energy, enterprise, and abil-\n","ity to make more money for the shareholders.* But there are two\n","offsetting factors, one of which is practically ignored and the other\n","entirely so in optimistic markets. The first is the actual dilution of\n","the current and future earnings on the common stock that flows\n","arithmetically from the new conversion rights. This dilution can be\n","quantified by taking the recent earnings, or assuming some other\n","figures, and calculating the adjusted earnings per share if all the\n","convertible shares or bonds were actually converted.

We consider the recent\n","development of stock-option warrants as a near fraud, an existing\n","menace, and a potential disaster. They have created huge aggregate\n","dollar “values” out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence\n","except to the extent that they mislead speculators and investors.\n","They should be prohibited by law, or at least strictly limited to a\n","minor part of the total capitalization of a company.*\n","For an analogy in general history and in literature we refer the\n","reader to the section of Faust (part 2), in which Goethe describes\n","the invention of paper money. As an ominous precedent on Wall\n","Street history, we may mention the warrants of American & For-\n","eign Power Co., which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a\n","billion dollars, although they appeared only in a footnote to the\n","company’s balance sheet. By 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to\n","$8 million, and in 1952 the warrants were wiped out in the\n","company’s recapitalization—even though it had remained solvent.\n","Originally, stock-option warrants were attached now and then\n","to bond issues, and were usually equivalent to a partial conversion\n","privilege. They were unimportant in amount, and hence did no\n","harm. Their use expanded in the late 1920s, along with many other\n","financial abuses, but they dropped from sight for long years there-\n","after. They were bound to turn up again, like the bad pennies they\n","are, and since 1967 they have become familiar “instruments of\n","Convertible Issues and Warrants\n","413\n","* Warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate finance in\n","the nineteenth century and were fairly common even in Graham’s day. They\n","have since diminished in importance and popularity—one of the few recent\n","developments that would give Graham unreserved pleasure. As of year-end\n","2002, there were only seven remaining warrant issues on the New York\n","Stock Exchange—only the ghostly vestige of a market. Because warrants are\n","no longer commonly used by major companies, today’s investors should\n","read the rest of Graham’s chapter only to see how his logic works.\n","finance.” In fact a standard procedure has developed for raising\n","the capital for new real-estate ventures, affiliates of large banks, by\n","selling units of an equal number of common shares and warrants\n","to buy additional common shares at the same price. Example: In\n","1971 CleveTrust Realty Investors sold 2,500,000 of these combina-\n","tions of common stock (or “shares of beneficial interest”) and war-\n","rants, for $20 per unit.\n","Let us consider for a moment what is really involved in this\n","financial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first right\n","to buy additional common shares when the company’s directors\n","find it desirable to raise capital in this manner. This so-called “pre-\n","emptive right” is one of the elements of value entering into the\n","ownership of common stock—along with the right to receive divi-\n","dends, to participate in the company’s growth, and to vote for\n","directors. When separate warrants are issued for the right to sub-\n","scribe additional capital, that action takes away part of the value\n","inherent in an ordinary common share and transfers it to a separate\n","certificate. An analogous thing could be done by issuing separate\n","certificates for the right to receive dividends (for a limited or\n","unlimited period), or the right to share in the proceeds of sale or\n","liquidation of the enterprise, or the right to vote the shares. Why\n","then are these subscription warrants created as part of the original\n","capital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial\n","matters. They don’t realize that the common stock is worth less\n","with warrants outstanding than otherwise. Hence the package of\n","stock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market\n","than would the stock alone. Note that in the usual company reports\n","the per-share earnings are (or have been) computed without\n","proper allowance for the effect of outstanding warrants.

Nearly all the newer warrants run for a limited\n","time—generally between five and ten years. The older warrants\n","were often perpetual, and they were likely to have fascinating price\n","histories over the years.\n","Example: The record books will show that Tri-Continental Corp.\n","warrants, which date from 1929, sold at a negligible 1/32 of a dol-\n","lar each in the depth of the depression.

To that extent there is a valid\n","argument for selling bonds with warrants attached rather than cre-\n","ating an equivalent dilution factor by a convertible issue. If the\n","warrant total is relatively small there is no point in taking its theo-\n","retical aspect too seriously; if the warrant issue is large relative to\n","the outstanding stock, that would probably indicate that the com-\n","pany has a top-heavy senior capitalization.

Its bankruptcy in 1970 shocked the financial world. It has\n","defaulted on most of its bond issues, and has been in danger of\n","abandoning its operations entirely. Its security issues fell drasti-\n","cally in price, the common stock collapsing from a high level of 861⁄2\n","as recently as 1968 to a low of 51⁄2 in 1970. (There seems little doubt\n","that these shares will be wiped out in reorganization.)*\n","Our basic point is that the application of the simplest rules of\n","security analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment\n","would have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Cen-\n","tral system long before its bankruptcy—certainly in 1968, when the\n","shares were selling at their post-1929 record, and when most of its\n","bond issues could have been exchanged at even prices for well-\n","secured public-utility obligations with the same coupon rates. The\n","following comments are in order:\n","1. In the S & P Bond Guide the interest charges of the system are\n","shown to have been earned 1.91 times in 1967 and 1.98 times in\n","1968. The minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our\n","textbook Security Analysis is 5 times before income taxes and 2.9\n","times after income taxes at regular rates. As far as we know the\n","validity of these standards has never been questioned by any\n","investment authority. On the basis of our requirements for earnings\n","after taxes, the Penn Central fell short of the requirements for safety.\n","But our after-tax requirement is based on a before-tax ratio of five\n","times, with regular income tax deducted after the bond interest. In\n","the case of Penn Central, it had been paying no income taxes to speak\n","of for the past 11 years! Hence the coverage of its interest charges\n","before taxes was less than two times—a totally inadequate figure\n","against our conservative requirement of 5 times.\n","Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\n","423\n","* How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s bankruptcy,\n","which was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The closing trade\n","in Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was $11.25 per share—hardly a\n","going-out-of-business price. In more recent times, stocks like Enron and\n","WorldCom have also sold at relatively high prices shortly before filing for\n","bankruptcy protection.\n","2. The fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a\n","period should have raised serious questions about the validity of its\n","reported earnings.\n","3. The bonds of the Penn Central system could have been\n","exchanged in 1968 and 1969, at no sacrifice of price or income, for\n","far better secured issues. For example, in 1969, Pennsylvania RR\n","41⁄2s, due 1994 (part of Penn Central) had a range of 61 to 741⁄2, while\n","Pennsylvania Electric Co. 43⁄8s, due 1994, had a range of 641⁄4 to 721⁄4.\n","The public utility had earned its interest 4.20 times before taxes in\n","1968 against only 1.98 times for the Penn Central system; during\n","1969 the latter’s comparative showing grew steadily worse. An\n","exchange of this sort was clearly called for, and it would have been\n","a lifesaver for a Penn Central bondholder. (At the end of 1970 the\n","railroad 41⁄4s were in default, and selling at only 181⁄2, while the\n","utility’s 43⁄8s closed at 661⁄2.)\n","4. Penn Central reported earnings of $3.80 per share in 1968; its\n","high price of 861⁄2 in that year was 24 times such earnings. But any\n","analyst worth his salt would have wondered how “real” were\n","earnings of this sort reported without the necessity of paying any\n","income taxes thereon.\n","5. For 1966 the newly merged company* had reported “earn-\n","ings” of $6.80 a share—in reflection of which the common stock\n","later rose to its peak of 861⁄2. This was a valuation of over $2 billion\n","for the equity.

The com-\n","pany it wished to acquire was thus seven times the size of NVF. In\n","early 1969 it made an offer for all the shares of Sharon. The terms\n","per share were $70 face amount of NVF junior 5% bonds, due 1994,\n","plus warrants to buy 11⁄2 shares of NVF stock at $22 per share of\n","NVF. The management of Sharon strenuously resisted this\n","takeover attempt, but in vain. NVF acquired 88% of the Sharon\n","stock under the offer, issuing therefore $102 million of its 5% bonds\n","and warrants for 2,197,000 of its shares. Had the offer been 100%\n","operative the consolidated enterprise would, for the year 1968,\n","have had $163 million in debt, only $2.2 million in tangible stock\n","capital, $250 million of sales. The net-earnings question would\n","have been a bit complicated, but the company subsequently stated\n","them as a net loss of 50 cents per share of NVF stocks, before an\n","extraordinary credit, and net earnings of 3 cents per share after\n","such credit.*\n","First Comment: Among all the takeovers effected in the year\n","1969 this was no doubt the most extreme in its financial dispropor-\n","tions. The acquiring company had assumed responsibility for a\n","new and top-heavy debt obligation, and it had changed its calcu-\n","lated 1968 earnings from a profit to a loss into the bargain.

The Commission alleged that Posner and his family had improperly\n","obtained $1.7 million in personal perks from NVF and Sharon, overstated\n","Sharon’s pretax earnings by $13.9 million, misrecorded inventory, and\n","“shifted income and expenses from one year to another.” Sharon Steel,\n","which Graham had singled out with his cold and skeptical eye, became\n","known among Wall Street wags as “Share and Steal.” Posner was later a\n","central force in the wave of leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers that\n","swept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a major customer for\n","the junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert.\n","step is found in the fact that the new 5% bonds did not sell higher\n","than 42 cents on the dollar during the year of issuance. This would\n","have indicated grave doubt of the safety of the bonds and of the\n","company’s future; however, the management actually exploited\n","the bond price in a way to save the company annual income taxes\n","of about $1,000,000 as will be shown.\n","The 1968 report, published after the Sharon takeover, contained\n","a condensed picture of its results, carried back to the year-end. This\n","contained two most unusual items:\n","1. There is listed as an asset $58,600,000 of “deferred debt\n","expense.” This sum is greater than the entire “stockholders’\n","equity,” placed at $40,200,000.\n","2. However, not included in the shareholders’ equity is an item\n","of $20,700,000 designated as “excess of equity over cost of invest-\n","ment in Sharon.”\n","Second Comment: If we eliminate the debt expense as an asset,\n","which it hardly seems to be, and include the other item in the\n","shareholders’ equity (where it would normally belong), then we\n","have a more realistic statement of tangible equity for NVF stock,\n","viz., $2,200,000. Thus the first effect of the deal was to reduce\n","NVF’s “real equity” from $17,400,000 to $2,200,000 or from $23.71\n","per share to about $3 per share, on 731,000 shares. In addition the\n","NVF shareholders had given to others the right to buy 31⁄2 times as\n","many additional shares at six points below the market price at the\n","close of 1968. The initial market value of the warrants was then\n","about $12 each, or a total of some $30 million for those involved in\n","the purchase offer. Actually, the market value of the warrants well\n","exceeded the total market value of the outstanding NVF stock—\n","another evidence of the tail-wagging-dog nature of the transaction.\n","The Accounting Gimmicks\n","When we pass from this pro forma balance sheet to the next\n","year’s report we find several strange-appearing entries. In addition\n","to the basic interest expense (a hefty $7,500,000), there is deducted\n","$1,795,000 for “amortization of deferred debt expense.” But this\n","last is nearly offset on the next line by a very unusual income item\n","Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\n","431\n","indeed: “amortization of equity over cost of investment in sub-\n","sidiary: Cr. $1,650,000.” In one of the footnotes we find an entry,\n","not appearing in any other report that we know of: Part of the stock\n","capital is there designated as “fair market value of warrants issued\n","in connection with acquisition, etc., $22,129,000.”\n","What on earth do all these entries mean? None of them is even\n","referred to in the descriptive text of the 1969 report. The trained\n","security analyst has to figure out these mysteries by himself,\n","almost in detective fashion. He finds that the underlying idea is to\n","derive a tax advantage from the low initial price of the 5% deben-\n","tures. For readers who may be interested in this ingenious arrange-\n","ment we set forth our solution in Appendix 6.\n","Other Unusual Items\n","1. Right after the close of 1969 the company bought in no less\n","than 650,000 warrants at a price of $9.38 each. This was extraordi-\n","nary when we consider that (a) NVF itself had only $700,000 in\n","cash at the year-end, and had $4,400,000 of debt due in 1970 (evi-\n","dently the $6 million paid for the warrants had to be borrowed); (b)\n","it was buying in this warrant “paper money” at a time when its 5%\n","bonds were selling at less than 40 cents on the dollar—ordinarily a\n","warning that financial difficulties lay ahead.\n","2. As a partial offset to this, the company had retired $5,100,000\n","of its bonds along with 253,000 warrants in exchange for a like\n","amount of common stock. This was possible because, by the\n","vagaries of the securities markets, people were selling the 5%\n","bonds at less than 40 while the common sold at an average price of\n","131⁄2, paying no dividend.\n","3. The company had plans in operation not only for selling stock\n","to its employees, but also for selling them a larger number of war-\n","rants to buy the stock. Like the stock purchases the warrants were\n","to be paid for 5% down and the rest over many years in the future.\n","This is the only such employee-purchase plan for warrants that we\n","know of. Will someone soon invent and sell on installments a right\n","to buy a right to buy a share, and so on?\n","4. In the year 1969 the newly controlled Sharon Steel Co.\n","changed its method of arriving at its pension costs, and also\n","432\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","adopted lower depreciation rates. These accounting changes added\n","about $1 per share to the reported earnings of NVF before dilution.\n","5. At the end of 1970 Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide reported that\n","NVF shares were selling at a price/earning ratio of only 2, the lowest\n","figure for all the 4,500-odd issues in the booklet. As the old Wall Street\n","saying went, this was “important if true.” The ratio was based on the\n","year’s closing price of 83⁄4 and the computed “earnings” of $5.38 per\n","share for the 12 months ended September 1970. (Using these figures\n","the shares were selling at only 1.6 times earnings.) But this ratio did\n","not allow for the large dilution factor,* nor for the adverse results\n","actually realized in the last quarter of 1970. When the full year’s fig-\n","ures finally appeared, they showed only $2.03 per share earned for\n","the stock, before allowing for dilution, and $1.80 per share on a\n","diluted basis. Note also that the aggregate market price of the stock\n","and warrants on that date was about $14 million against a bonded\n","debt of $135 million—a skimpy equity position indeed.\n","AAA Enterprises\n","History\n","About 15 years ago a college student named Williams began\n","selling mobile homes (then called “trailers”).† In 1965 he incorpo-\n","Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\n","433\n","* The “large dilution factor” would be triggered when NVF employees exer-\n","cised their warrants to buy common stock. The company would then have to\n","issue more shares, and its net earnings would be divided across a much\n","greater number of shares outstanding.\n","† Jackie G. Williams founded AAA Enterprises in 1958. On its first day of trad-\n","ing, the stock soared 56% to close at $20.25. Williams later announced that\n","AAA would come up with a new franchising concept every month (if people\n","would step into a mobile home to get their income taxes done by “Mr. Tax of\n","America,” just imagine what else they might do inside a trailer!). But AAA ran\n","out of time and money before Williams ran out of ideas. The history of AAA\n","Enterprises is reminiscent of the saga of a later company with charismatic man-\n","agement and scanty assets: ZZZZ Best achieved a stock-market value of\n","roughly $200 million in the late 1980s, even though its purported industrial\n","vacuum-cleaning business was little more than a telephone and a rented office\n","run by a teenager named Barry Minkow. ZZZZ Best went bust and Minkow\n","rated his business. In that year he sold $5,800,000 of mobile homes\n","and earned $61,000 before corporate tax. By 1968 he had joined the\n","“franchising” movement and was selling others the right to sell\n","mobile homes under his business name. He also conceived the\n","bright idea of going into the business of preparing income-tax\n","returns, using his mobile homes as offices. He formed a subsidiary\n","company called Mr. Tax of America, and of course started to sell\n","franchises to others to use the idea and the name. He multiplied\n","the number of corporate shares to 2,710,000 and was ready for a\n","stock offering. He found that one of our largest stock-exchange\n","houses, along with others, was willing to handle the deal. In March\n","1969 they offered the public 500,000 shares of AAA Enterprises at\n","$13 per share. Of these, 300,000 were sold for Mr. Williams’s per-\n","sonal account and 200,000 were sold for the company account,\n","adding $2,400,000 to its resources. The price of the stock promptly\n","doubled to 28, or a value of $84 million for the equity, against a\n","book value of, say, $4,200,000 and maximum reported earnings of\n","$690,000. The stock was thus selling at a tidy 115 times its current\n","(and largest) earnings per share. No doubt Mr. Williams had\n","selected the name AAA Enterprise so that it might be among the\n","first in the phone books and the yellow pages. A collateral result\n","was that his company was destined to appear as the first name in\n","Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide. Like Abu-Ben-Adhem’s, it led all\n","the rest.* This gives a special reason to select it as a harrowing\n","example of 1969 new financing and “hot issues.”\n","Comment: This was not a bad deal for Mr. Williams. The\n","300,000 shares he sold had a book value in December of 1968 of\n","$180,000 and he netted therefor 20 times as much, or a cool\n","$3,600,000. The underwriters and distributors split $500,000\n","between them, less expenses.\n","434\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","went to jail. Even as you read this, another similar company is being formed,\n","and a new generation of “investors” will be taken for a ride. No one who has\n","read Graham, however, should climb on board.\n","* In “Abou Ben Adhem,” by the British Romantic poet Leigh Hunt\n","(1784–1859), a righteous Muslim sees an angel writing in a golden book\n","“the names of those who love the Lord.” When the angel tells Abou that his\n","name is not among them, Abou says, “I pray thee, then, write me as one that\n","loves his fellow men.” The angel returns the next night to show Abou the\n","book, in which now “Ben Adhem’s name led all the rest.”\n","1. This did not seem so brilliant a deal for the clients of the sell-\n","ing houses. They were asked to pay about ten times the book value\n","of the stock, after the bootstrap operation of increasing their equity\n","per share from 59 cents to $1.35 with their own money.* Before the\n","best year 1968, the company’s maximum earnings had been a\n","ridiculous 7 cents per share. There were ambitious plans for the\n","future, of course—but the public was being asked to pay heavily in\n","advance for the hoped-for realization of these plans.\n","2. Nonetheless, the price of the stock doubled soon after original\n","issuance, and any one of the brokerage-house clients could have\n","gotten out at a handsome profit. Did this fact alter the flotation, or\n","did the advance possibility that it might happen exonerate the\n","original distributors of the issue from responsibility for this public\n","offering and its later sequel? Not an easy question to answer, but it\n","deserves careful consideration by Wall Street and the government\n","regulatory agencies.†\n","Subsequent History\n","With its enlarged capital AAA Enterprises went into two addi-\n","tional businesses. In 1969 it opened a chain of retail carpet stores, and\n","it acquired a plant that manufactured mobile homes. The results\n","reported for the first nine months were not exactly brilliant, but they\n","were a little better than the year before—22 cents a share against 14\n","Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\n","435\n","* By purchasing more common stock at a premium to its book value, the\n","investing public increased the value of AAA’s equity per share. But investors\n","were only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, since most of the\n","rise in shareholders’ equity came from the public’s own willingness to over-\n","pay for the stock.\n","† Graham’s point is that investment banks are not entitled to take credit for\n","the gains a hot stock may produce right after its initial public offering unless\n","they are also willing to take the blame for the stock’s performance in the\n","longer term. Many Internet IPOs rose 1,000% or more in 1999 and early\n","2000; most of them lost more than 95% in the subsequent three years.\n","How could these early gains earned by a few investors justify the massive\n","destruction of wealth suffered by the millions who came later? Many IPOs\n","were, in fact, deliberately underpriced to “manufacture” immediate gains\n","that would attract more attention for the next offering.\n","cents. What happened in the next months was literally incredible.\n","The company lost $4,365,000, or $1.49 per share. This consumed all its\n","capital before the financing, plus the entire $2,400,000 received on the\n","sale of stock plus two-thirds of the amount reported as earned in the\n","first nine months of 1969. There was left a pathetic $242,000, or 8 cents\n","per share, of capital for the public shareholders who had paid $13 for\n","the new offering only seven months before. Nonetheless the shares\n","closed the year 1969 at 81⁄8 bid, or a “valuation” of more than $25 mil-\n","lion for the company.\n","Further Comment: 1. It is too much to believe that the company\n","had actually earned $686,000 from January to September 1969 and\n","then lost $4,365,000 in the next three months. There was something\n","sadly, badly, and accusingly wrong about the September 30 report.\n","2. The year’s closing price of 81⁄8 bid was even more of a demon-\n","stration of the complete heedlessness of stock-market prices than\n","were the original offering price of 13 or the subsequent “hot-issue”\n","advance to a high bid of 28. These latter quotations at least were\n","based on enthusiasm and hope—out of all proportion to reality and\n","common sense, but at least comprehensible. The year-end valuation\n","of $25 million was given to a company that had lost all but a minus-\n","cule remnant of its capital, for which a completely insolvent condi-\n","tion was imminent, and for which the words “enthusiasm” or “hope”\n","would be only bitter sarcasms. (It is true the year-end figures had not\n","been published by December 31, but it is the business of Wall Street\n","houses associated with a company to have monthly operating state-\n","ments and a fairly exact idea of how things are going.)\n","Final Chapter\n","For the first half of 1970 the company reported a further loss of\n","$1 million. It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out\n","of bankruptcy by loans made by Mr. Williams, up to a total of\n","$2,500,000. No further statements seem to have been issued, until\n","in January 1971 AAA Enterprises finally filed a petition in bank-\n","ruptcy. The quotation for the stock at month-end was still 50 cents\n","a share bid, or $1,500,000 for the entire issue, which evidently had\n","no more than wallpaper value.

The capital structure of Presto was as simple as it\n","could be—nothing but 1,478,000 shares of common stock, selling in\n","the market for $58 million. Contrastingly, General had more than\n","twice as many shares of common, plus an issue of convertible pre-\n","ferred, plus three issues of stock warrants calling for a huge\n","amount of common, plus a towering convertible bond issue (just\n","given in exchange for stock of an insurance company), plus a\n","goodly sum of nonconvertible bonds.

These assumptions\n","actually produced virtually no effect on the earnings per share in\n","calendar 1968—which were reported as $1.51 both before and after\n","allowance for dilution. We consider this treatment illogical and\n","unrealistic. As we see it, the warrants represent a part of the “com-\n","mon-stock package” and their market value is part of the “effective\n","market value” of the common-stock part of the capital. (See our\n","discussion of this point on p. 415 above.) This simple technique of\n","adding the market price of the warrants to that of the common has\n","a radical effect on the showing of National General at the end of\n","1968, as appears from the calculation in Table 18-7.

We have asked them to take a generous attitude toward\n","those who are demonstrably doing a good job. We have asked\n","them also to demand clear and satisfying explanations when the\n","results appear to be worse than they should be, and to support\n","movements to improve or remove clearly unproductive manage-\n","ments. Shareholders are justified in raising questions as to the com-\n","petence of the management when the results (1) are unsatisfactory\n","in themselves, (2) are poorer than those obtained by other compa-\n","nies that appear similarly situated, and (3) have resulted in an\n","unsatisfactory market price of long duration.\n","In the last 36 years practically nothing has actually been accom-\n","plished through intelligent action by the great body of sharehold-\n","ers. A sensible crusader—if there are any such—would take this as\n","a sign that he has been wasting his time, and that he had better\n","give up the fight. As it happens our cause has not been lost; it has\n","been rescued by an extraneous development—known as take-\n","overs, or take-over bids.* We said in Chapter 8 that poor manage-\n","487\n","* Ironically, takeovers began drying up shortly after Graham’s last revised\n","edition appeared, and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the absolute low\n","point of modern American industrial efficiency. Cars were “lemons,” televi-\n","sions and radios were constantly “on the fritz,” and the managers of many\n","publicly-traded companies ignored both the present interests of their out-\n","side shareholders and the future prospects of their own businesses. All of\n","ments produce poor market prices. The low market prices, in turn,\n","attract the attention of companies interested in diversifying their\n","operations—and these are now legion. Innumerable such acquisi-\n","tions have been accomplished by agreement with the existing man-\n","agements, or else by accumulation of shares in the market and by\n","offers made over the head of those in control. The price bid has\n","usually been within the range of the value of the enterprise under\n","reasonably competent management. Hence, in many cases, the\n","inert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions of “out-\n","siders”—who at times may be enterprising individuals or groups\n","acting on their own.\n","It can be stated as a rule with very few exceptions that poor\n","managements are not changed by action of the “public stockhold-\n","ers,” but only by the assertion of control by an individual or com-\n","pact group. This is happening often enough these days to put the\n","management, including the board of directors, of a typical publicly\n","controlled company on notice that if its operating results and the\n","resulting market price are highly unsatisfactory, it may become the\n","target of a successful take-over move. As a consequence, boards of\n","directors have probably become more alive than previously to their\n","fundamental duty to see that their company has a satisfactory top\n","management. Many more changes of presidents have been seen in\n","recent years than formerly.\n","Not all companies in the unsatisfactory class have benefited\n","from such developments. Also, the change has often occurred after\n","a long period of bad results without remedial action, and has\n","depended on enough disappointed shareholders selling out at low\n","prices to permit the energetic outsiders to acquire a controlling\n","position in the shares. But the idea that public shareholders could\n","really help themselves by supporting moves for improving man-\n","agement and management policies has proved too quixotic to war-\n","488\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","this began to change in 1984, when independent oilman T.

Those individual shareholders who\n","have enough gumption to make their presence felt at annual meet-\n","ings—generally a completely futile performance—will not need\n","our counsel on what points to raise with the managements. For\n","others the advice would probably be wasted. Nevertheless, let us\n","close this section with the plea that shareholders consider with an\n","open mind and with careful attention any proxy material sent them\n","by fellow-shareholders who want to remedy an obviously unsatis-\n","factory management situation in the company.\n","Shareholders and Dividend Policy\n","In the past the dividend policy was a fairly frequent subject of\n","argument between public, or “minority,” shareholders and man-\n","agements. In general these shareholders wanted more liberal divi-\n","dends, while the managements preferred to keep the earnings in\n","the business “to strengthen the company.” They asked the share-\n","holders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enter-\n","prise and for their own future long-term benefit. But in recent years\n","the attitude of investors toward dividends has been undergoing a\n","gradual but significant change. The basic argument now for paying\n","small rather than liberal dividends is not that the company\n","“needs” the money, but rather that it can use it to the shareholders’\n","direct and immediate advantage by retaining the funds for prof-\n","itable expansion. Years ago it was typically the weak company that\n","was more or less forced to hold on to its profits, instead of paying\n","out the usual 60% to 75% of them in dividends. The effect was\n","almost always adverse to the market price of the shares. Nowadays\n","it is quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliber-\n","ately keeps down its dividend payments, with the approval of\n","investors and speculators alike.*\n","There was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting prof-\n","Shareholders and Managements\n","489\n","* The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the 1990s,\n","when it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less likely it\n","was to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one. The “payout\n","ratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies paid out as div-\n","idends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35% to 40% by\n","the end of the 1990s.\n","its in the business where such retention could be counted on to\n","produce a goodly increase in earnings. But there were several\n","strong counter-arguments, such as: The profits “belong” to the\n","shareholders, and they are entitled to have them paid out within\n","the limits of prudent management; many of the shareholders need\n","their dividend income to live on; the earnings they receive in divi-\n","dends are “real money,” while those retained in the company may\n","or may not show up later as tangible values for the shareholders.\n","These counter-arguments were so compelling, in fact, that the stock\n","market showed a persistent bias in favor of the liberal dividend\n","payers as against the companies that paid no dividends or rela-\n","tively small ones.1\n","In the last 20 years the “profitable reinvestment” theory has\n","been gaining ground. The better the past record of growth, the\n","readier investors and speculators have become to accept a low-\n","pay-out policy. So much is this true that in many cases of growth\n","favorites the dividend rate—or even the absence of any dividend—\n","has seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price.*\n","A striking example of this development is found in the history\n","of Texas Instruments, Incorporated. The price of its common stock\n","rose from 5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960, while earnings were advancing\n","from 43 cents to $3.91 per share and while no dividend of any kind\n","was paid. (In 1962 cash dividends were initiated, but by that year\n","the earnings had fallen to $2.14 and the price had shown a spectac-\n","ular drop to a low of 49.)\n","Another extreme illustration is provided by Superior Oil. In\n","1948 the company reported earnings of $35.26 per share, paid $3 in\n","dividends, and sold as high as 235. In 1953 the dividend was\n","reduced to $1, but the high price was 660. In 1957 it paid no dividend\n","490\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong advo-\n","cates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back into the\n","business,” where they could earn higher returns than any outside share-\n","holder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it were paid out to him\n","or her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never questioned the truth of this\n","patronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or even realized that a company’s\n","cash belongs to the shareholders, not its managers. See the commentary\n","on this chapter.\n","at all, and sold at 2,000! This unusual issue later declined to 795 in\n","1962, when it earned $49.50 and paid $7.50.*\n","Investment sentiment is far from crystallized in this matter of\n","dividend policy of growth companies. The conflicting views are\n","well illustrated by the cases of two of our very largest corpora-\n","tions—American Telephone & Telegraph and International Busi-\n","ness Machines. American Tel. & Tel. came to be regarded as an\n","issue with good growth possibilities, as shown by the fact that in\n","1961 it sold at 25 times that year’s earnings. Nevertheless, the\n","company’s cash dividend policy has remained an investment and\n","speculative consideration of first importance, its quotation making\n","an active response to even rumors of an impending increase in the\n","dividend rate. On the other hand, comparatively little attention\n","appears to have been paid to the cash dividend on IBM, which in\n","1960 yielded only 0.5% at the high price of the year and 1.5% at the\n","close of 1970. (But in both cases stock splits have operated as a\n","potent stock-market influence.)\n","The market’s appraisal of cash-dividend policy appears to be\n","developing in the following direction: Where prime emphasis is\n","not placed on growth the stock is rated as an “income issue,” and\n","the dividend rate retains its long-held importance as the prime\n","determinant of market price. At the other extreme, stocks clearly\n","recognized to be in the rapid-growth category are valued primarily\n","in terms of the expected growth rate over, say, the next decade, and\n","the cash-dividend rate is more or less left out of the reckoning.\n","While the above statement may properly describe present ten-\n","dencies, it is by no means a clear-cut guide to the situation in all\n","common stocks, and perhaps not in the majority of them. For one\n","thing, many companies occupy an intermediate position between\n","growth and nongrowth enterprises. It is hard to say how much\n","importance should be ascribed to the growth factor in such cases,\n","and the market’s view thereof may change radically from year to\n","year. Secondly, there seems to be something paradoxical about\n","Shareholders and Managements\n","491\n","* Superior Oil’s stock price peaked at $2165 per share in 1959, when it\n","paid a $4 dividend. For many years, Superior was the highest-priced stock\n","listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Superior, controlled by the Keck\n","family of Houston, was acquired by Mobil Corp. in 1984.\n","requiring the companies showing slower growth to be more liberal\n","with their cash dividends. For these are generally the less prosper-\n","ous concerns, and in the past the more prosperous the company the\n","greater was the expectation of both liberal and increasing pay-\n","ments.\n","It is our belief that shareholders should demand of their man-\n","agements either a normal payout of earnings—on the order, say, of\n","two-thirds—or else a clear-cut demonstration that the reinvested\n","profits have produced a satisfactory increase in per-share earnings.\n","Such a demonstration could ordinarily be made in the case of a rec-\n","ognized growth company. But in many other cases a low payout is\n","clearly the cause of an average market price that is below fair\n","value, and here the shareholders have every right to inquire and\n","probably to complain.\n","A niggardly policy has often been imposed on a company\n","because its financial position is relatively weak, and it has needed\n","all or most of its earnings (plus depreciation charges) to pay debts\n","and bolster its working-capital position. When this is so there is not\n","much the shareholders can say about it—except perhaps to criticize\n","the management for permitting the company to fall into such an\n","unsatisfactory financial position. However, dividends are some-\n","times held down by relatively unprosperous companies for the\n","declared purpose of expanding the business. We feel that such a\n","policy is illogical on its face, and should require both a complete\n","explanation and a convincing defense before the shareholders\n","should accept it. In terms of the past record there is no reason a pri-\n","ori to believe that the owners will benefit from expansion moves\n","undertaken with their money by a business showing mediocre\n","results and continuing its old management.\n","Stock Dividends and Stock Splits\n","It is important that investors understand the essential difference\n","between a stock dividend (properly so-called) and a stock split.\n","The latter represents a restatement of the common-stock struc-\n","ture—in a typical case by issuing two or three shares for one. The\n","new shares are not related to specific earnings reinvested in a spe-\n","cific past period. Its purpose is to establish a lower market price for\n","the single shares, presumably because such lower price range\n","492\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","would be more acceptable to old and new shareholders. A stock\n","split may be carried out by what technically may be called a stock\n","dividend, which involves a transfer of sums from earned surplus\n","to capital account; or else by a change in par value, which does not\n","affect the surplus account.*\n","What we should call a proper stock dividend is one that is paid to\n","shareholders to give them a tangible evidence or representation of\n","specific earnings which have been reinvested in the business for\n","their account over some relatively short period in the recent past—\n","say, not more than the two preceding years. It is now approved\n","practice to value such a stock dividend at the approximate value at\n","the time of declaration, and to transfer an amount equal to such\n","value from earned surplus to capital accounts. Thus the amount of\n","a typical stock dividend is relatively small—in most cases not more\n","than 5%. In essence a stock dividend of this sort has the same over-\n","all effect as the payment of an equivalent amount of cash out of\n","earnings when accompanied by the sale of additional shares of like\n","total value to the shareholders. However, a straight stock dividend\n","has an important tax advantage over the otherwise equivalent\n","combination of cash dividends with stock subscription rights,\n","which is the almost standard practice for public-utility companies.\n","The New York Stock Exchange has set the figure of 25% as a\n","practical dividing line between stock splits and stock dividends.\n","Those of 25% or more need not be accompanied by the transfer of\n","their market value from earned surplus to capital, and so forth.†\n","Some companies, especially banks, still follow the old practice of\n","Shareholders and Managements\n","493\n","* Today, virtually all stock splits are carried out by a change in value. In a\n","two-for-one split, one share becomes two, each trading at half the former\n","price of the original single share; in a three-for-one split, one share becomes\n","three, each trading at a third of the former price; and so on. Only in very rare\n","cases is a sum transferred “from earned surplus to capital account,” as in\n","Graham’s day.\n","† Rule 703 of the New York Stock Exchange governs stock splits and stock\n","dividends. The NYSE now designates stock dividends of greater than 25%\n","and less than 100% as “partial stock splits.” Unlike in Graham’s day, these\n","stock dividends may now trigger the NYSE’s accounting requirement that\n","the amount of the dividend be capitalized from retained earnings.\n","declaring any kind of stock dividend they please—e.g., one of 10%,\n","not related to recent earnings—and these instances maintain an\n","undesirable confusion in the financial world.\n","We have long been a strong advocate of a systematic and clearly\n","enunciated policy with respect to the payment of cash and stock\n","dividends. Under such a policy, stock dividends are paid periodi-\n","cally to capitalize all or a stated portion of the earnings reinvested\n","in the business. Such a policy—covering 100% of the reinvested\n","earnings—has been followed by Purex, Government Employees\n","Insurance, and perhaps a few others.*\n","Stock dividends of all types seem to be disapproved of by most\n","academic writers on the subject. They insist that they are nothing\n","but pieces of paper, that they give the shareholders nothing they\n","did not have before, and that they entail needless expense and\n","inconvenience.† On our side we consider this a completely doctri-\n","naire view, which fails to take into account the practical and \n","psychological realities of investment. True, a periodic stock divi-\n","dend—say of 5%—changes only the “form” of the owners’ invest-\n","ment. He has 105 shares in place of 100; but without the stock\n","dividend the original 100 shares would have represented the same\n","494\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* This policy, already unusual in Graham’s day, is extremely rare today. In\n","1936 and again in 1950, roughly half of all stocks on the NYSE paid a\n","so-called special dividend. By 1970, however, that percentage had declined\n","to less than 10% and, by the 1990s, was well under 5%. See Harry DeAn-\n","gelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Special Dividends and the\n","Evolution of Dividend Signaling,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 57, no.\n","3, September, 2000, pp. 309–354. The most plausible explanation for this\n","decline is that corporate managers became uncomfortable with the idea\n","that shareholders might interpret special dividends as a signal that future\n","profits might be low.\n","† The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and Franco\n","Modigliani, whose influential article “Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valua-\n","tion of Shares” (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in Economics. Miller\n","and Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were irrelevant, since an\n","investor should not care whether his return comes through dividends and a\n","rising stock price, or through a rising stock price alone, so long as the total\n","return is the same in either case.\n","ownership interest now embodied in his 105 shares. Nonetheless,\n","the change of form is actually one of real importance and value to\n","him. If he wishes to cash in his share of the reinvested profits he\n","can do so by selling the new certificate sent him, instead of having\n","to break up his original certificate. He can count on receiving the\n","same cash-dividend rate on 105 shares as formerly on his 100\n","shares; a 5% rise in the cash-dividend rate without the stock divi-\n","dend would not be nearly as probable.*\n","The advantages of a periodic stock-dividend policy are most\n","evident when it is compared with the usual practice of the public-\n","utility companies of paying liberal cash dividends and then taking\n","back a good part of this money from the shareholders by selling\n","them additional stock (through subscription rights).† As we men-\n","tioned above, the shareholders would find themselves in exactly\n","the same position if they received stock dividends in lieu of the\n","popular combination of cash dividends followed by stock sub-\n","scriptions—except that they would save the income tax otherwise\n","paid on the cash dividends. Those who need or wish the maximum\n","annual cash income, with no additional stock, can get this result by\n","selling their stock dividends, in the same way as they sell their sub-\n","scription rights under present practice.\n","The aggregate amount of income tax that could be saved by sub-\n","stituting stock dividends for the present stock-dividends-plus-\n","subscription-rights combination is enormous. We urge that this\n","Shareholders and Managements\n","495\n","* Graham’s argument is no longer valid, and today’s investors can safely\n","skip over this passage. Shareholders no longer need to worry about “having\n","to break up” a stock certificate, since virtually all shares now exist in elec-\n","tronic rather than paper form. And when Graham says that a 5% increase in\n","a cash dividend on 100 shares is less “probable” than a constant dividend\n","on 105 shares, it’s unclear how he could even calculate that probability.\n","† Subscription rights, often simply known as “rights,” are used less fre-\n","quently than in Graham’s day. They confer upon an existing shareholder the\n","right to buy new shares, sometimes at a discount to market price. A share-\n","holder who does not participate will end up owning proportionately less of\n","the company. Thus, as is the case with so many other things that go by the\n","name of “rights,” some coercion is often involved. Rights are most common\n","today among closed-end funds and insurance or other holding companies.\n","change be made by the public utilities, despite its adverse effect on\n","the U.S. Treasury, because we are convinced that it is completely\n","inequitable to impose a second (personal) income tax on earnings\n","which are not really received by the shareholders, since the compa-\n","nies take the same money back through sales of stock.*\n","Efficient corporations continuously modernize their facilities,\n","their products, their bookkeeping, their management-training pro-\n","grams, their employee relations.

By his last revised edition, however, Graham had pared the\n","whole discussion back to less than eight terse pages about dividends.\n","Why did Graham cut away more than three-quarters of his original\n","argument?

Graham adds dryly that “such\n","action is almost unheard of in practice.” This, he says, “highlights the wide\n","gulf between what should happen and what does happen in shareholder-\n","management relationships.”\n","T H E  I N T E L L I G E N T  O W N E R\n","Today’s investors have forgotten Graham’s message. They put most of\n","their effort into buying a stock, a little into selling it—but none into own-\n","ing it. “Certainly,” Graham reminds us, “there is just as much reason to\n","exercise care and judgment in being as in becoming a stockholder.” 3\n","So how should you, as an intelligent investor, go about being an\n","intelligent owner? Graham starts by telling us that “there are just two\n","basic questions to which stockholders should turn their attention:\n","1. Is the management reasonably efficient?\n","2. Are the interests of the average outside shareholder receiving\n","proper recognition?” 4\n","You should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each\n","company’s profitability, size, and competitiveness against similar firms\n","in its industry. What if you conclude that the managers are no good?\n","Then, urges Graham,\n","A few of the more substantial stockholders should become convinced\n","that a change is needed and should be willing to work toward that\n","end. Second, the rank and file of the stockholders should be open-\n","minded enough to read the proxy material and to weigh the argu-\n","ments on both sides. They must at least be able to know when their\n","company has been unsuccessful and be ready to demand more than\n","artful platitudes as a vindication of the incumbent management. Third,\n","it would be most helpful, when the figures clearly show that the\n","results are well below average, if it became the custom to call in out-\n","side business engineers to pass upon the policies and competence\n","of the management.5\n","Commentary on Chapter 19\n","499\n","3 Graham and Dodd, Security Analysis (1934 ed.), p. 508.\n","4 The Intelligent Investor, 1949 edition, p. 218.\n","5 1949 edition, p. 223.

The objective of efficient operation is to produce at low\n","cost and to find the most profitable articles to sell.

For example, a railroad should have earned its total fixed\n","charges better than five times (before income tax), taking a period\n","of years, for its bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. This\n","past ability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the\n","margin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor against\n","loss or discomfiture in the event of some future decline in net\n","income. (The margin above charges may be stated in other ways—\n","512\n","* “It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a\n","sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all\n","times and situations. They presented him the words: ‘And this, too, shall\n","pass away.’ How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!—\n","how consoling in the depths of affliction! ‘And this, too, shall pass away.’ And\n","yet let us hope it is not quite true.”—Abraham Lincoln, Address to the Wis-\n","consin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, September 30, 1859, in Abra-\n","ham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings, 1859–1865 (Library of America,\n","1985), vol. II, p. 101.\n","for example, in the percentage by which revenues or profits may\n","decline before the balance after interest disappears—but the under-\n","lying idea remains the same.)\n","The bond investor does not expect future average earnings to\n","work out the same as in the past; if he were sure of that, the margin\n","demanded might be small. Nor does he rely to any controlling\n","extent on his judgment as to whether future earnings will be mate-\n","rially better or poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have\n","to measure his margin in terms of a carefully projected income\n","account, instead of emphasizing the margin shown in the past\n","record. Here the function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that\n","of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the\n","margin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earn-\n","ings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor\n","to feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.\n","The margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively,\n","by comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of\n","debt. (A similar calculation may be made for a preferred-stock\n","issue.) If the business owes $10 million and is fairly worth $30 mil-\n","lion, there is room for a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least\n","theoretically—before the bondholders will suffer loss. The amount\n","of this extra value, or “cushion,” above the debt may be approxi-\n","mated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues\n","over a period of years. Since average stock prices are generally\n","related to average earning power, the margin of “enterprise value”\n","over debt and the margin of earnings over charges will in most\n","cases yield similar results.\n","So much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-\n","value investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of common\n","stocks? Yes, but with some necessary modifications.\n","There are instances where a common stock may be considered\n","sound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good\n","bond. This will occur, for example, when a company has outstand-\n","ing only common stock that under depression conditions is selling\n","for less than the amount of bonds that could safely be issued\n","against its property and earning power.* That was the position of a\n","“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment\n","513\n","* “Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential profits or, as\n","he puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to earn year after year\n","host of strongly financed industrial companies at the low price lev-\n","els of 1932–33. In such instances the investor can obtain the margin\n","of safety associated with a bond, plus all the chances of larger\n","income and principal appreciation inherent in a common stock.\n","(The only thing he lacks is the legal power to insist on dividend\n","payments “or else”—but this is a small drawback as compared\n","with his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such circum-\n","stances will supply an ideal, though infrequent, combination of\n","safety and profit opportunity. As a quite recent example of this con-\n","dition, let us mention once more National Presto Industries stock,\n","which sold for a total enterprise value of $43 million in 1972. With\n","its $16 millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could\n","easily have supported this amount of bonds.\n","In the ordinary common stock, bought for investment under\n","normal conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning\n","power considerably above the going rate for bonds. In former edi-\n","tions we elucidated this point with the following figures:\n","Assume in a typical case that the earning power is 9% on the\n","price and that the bond rate is 4%; then the stockbuyer will have\n","an average annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. Some of the\n","excess is paid to him in the dividend rate; even though spent by\n","him, it enters into his overall investment result. The undistributed\n","balance is reinvested in the business for his account. In many cases\n","such reinvested earnings fail to add commensurately to the earn-\n","ing power and value of his stock. (That is why the market has a\n","stubborn habit of valuing earnings disbursed in dividends more\n","generously than the portion retained in the business.)* But, if the\n","picture is viewed as a whole, there is a reasonably close connection\n","514\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","if the business conditions prevailing during the period were to continue\n","unchanged” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 354). Some of his lectures\n","make it clear that Graham intended the term to cover periods of five years or\n","more. You can crudely but conveniently approximate a company’s earning\n","power per share by taking the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock with\n","a P/E ratio of 11 can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by\n","11). Today “earning power” is often called “earnings yield.”\n","* This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on Chapter 19.\n","between the growth of corporate surpluses through reinvested\n","earnings and the growth of corporate values.\n","Over a ten-year period the typical excess of stock earning\n","power over bond interest may aggregate 50% of the price paid.\n","This figure is sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety—\n","which, under favorable conditions, will prevent or minimize a\n","loss. If such a margin is present in each of a diversified list of\n","twenty or more stocks, the probability of a favorable result under\n","“fairly normal conditions” becomes very large. That is why the\n","policy of investing in representative common stocks does not\n","require high qualities of insight and foresight to work out success-\n","fully. If the purchases are made at the average level of the market\n","over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assur-\n","ance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies\n","in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market,\n","or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more\n","than average risk of diminished earning power.\n","As we see it, the whole problem of common-stock investment\n","under 1972 conditions lies in the fact that “in a typical case” the\n","earning power is now much less than 9% on the price paid.* Let us\n","assume that by concentrating somewhat on the low-multiplier\n","issues among the large companies a defensive investor may now\n","“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment\n","515\n","* Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a lecture he\n","gave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between the percent-\n","age rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate\n","of interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is the difference which would\n","absorb unsatisfactory developments. At the time the 1965 edition of The\n","Intelligent Investor was written the typical stock was selling at 11 times\n","earnings, giving about 9% return as against 4% on bonds. In that case you\n","had a margin of safety of over 100 per cent. Now [in 1972] there is no dif-\n","ference between the earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks,\n","and I say there is no margin of safety . . . you have a negative margin of\n","safety on stocks . . .” See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analy-\n","sis” [transcript of lecture at the Northeast Missouri State University busi-\n","ness school, March, 1972], Financial History, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.\n","acquire equities at 12 times recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings\n","return of 8.33% on cost. He may obtain a dividend yield of about\n","4%, and he will have 4.33% of his cost reinvested in the business for\n","his account. On this basis, the excess of stock earning power over\n","bond interest over a ten-year basis would still be too small to con-\n","stitute an adequate margin of safety. For that reason we feel that\n","there are real risks now even in a diversified list of sound common\n","stocks. The risks may be fully offset by the profit possibilities of \n","the list; and indeed the investor may have no choice but to incur\n","them—for otherwise he may run an even greater risk of holding\n","only fixed claims payable in steadily depreciating dollars. None-\n","theless the investor would do well to recognize, and to accept \n","as philosophically as he can, that the old package of good profit \n","possibilities combined with small ultimate risk is no longer available \n","to him.*\n","However, the risk of paying too high a price for good-quality\n","stocks—while a real one—is not the chief hazard confronting the\n","average buyer of securities. Observation over many years has\n","taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase\n","of low-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions.\n","The purchasers view the current good earnings as equivalent to\n","“earning power” and assume that prosperity is synonymous with\n","safety. It is in those years that bonds and preferred stocks of infe-\n","rior grade can be sold to the public at a price around par, because\n","they carry a little higher income return or a deceptively attractive\n","conversion privilege. It is then, also, that common stocks of\n","obscure companies can be floated at prices far above the tangible\n","investment, on the strength of two or three years of excellent\n","growth.\n","These securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any\n","admissible sense of the term. Coverage of interest charges and pre-\n","ferred dividends must be tested over a number of years, including\n","preferably a period of subnormal business such as in 1970–71. The\n","same is ordinarily true of common-stock earnings if they are to\n","516\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","* This paragraph—which Graham wrote in early 1972—is an uncannily pre-\n","cise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more detail, see the\n","commentary on Chapter 3.)\n","qualify as indicators of earning power. Thus it follows that most of\n","the fair-weather investments, acquired at fair-weather prices, are\n","destined to suffer disturbing price declines when the horizon\n","clouds over—and often sooner than that. Nor can the investor\n","count with confidence on an eventual recovery—although this\n","does come about in some proportion of the cases—for he has never\n","had a real safety margin to tide him through adversity.\n","The philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part\n","and in part contravenes the margin-of-safety principle. The\n","growth-stock buyer relies on an expected earning power that is\n","greater than the average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to\n","substitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating\n","his margin of safety. In investment theory there is no reason why\n","carefully estimated future earnings should be a less reliable guide\n","than the bare record of the past; in fact, security analysis is coming\n","more and more to prefer a competently executed evaluation of the\n","future. Thus the growth-stock approach may supply as dependable\n","a margin of safety as is found in the ordinary investment—\n","provided the calculation of the future is conservatively made, and\n","provided it shows a satisfactory margin in relation to the price\n","paid.\n","The danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For\n","such favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices that\n","will not be adequately protected by a conservative projection of\n","future earnings. (It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all\n","estimates, when they differ from past performance, must err at\n","least slightly on the side of understatement.) The margin of safety\n","is always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price,\n","small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price. If,\n","as we suggest, the average market level of most growth stocks is\n","too high to provide an adequate margin of safety for the buyer,\n","then a simple technique of diversified buying in this field may not\n","work out satisfactorily. A special degree of foresight and judgment\n","will be needed, in order that wise individual selections may over-\n","come the hazards inherent in the customary market level of such\n","issues as a whole.\n","The margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when\n","we apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We\n","have here, by definition, a favorable difference between price on\n","“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment\n","517\n","the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. That\n","difference is the safety margin. It is available for absorbing the\n","effect of miscalculations or worse than average luck. The buyer of\n","bargain issues places particular emphasis on the ability of the\n","investment to withstand adverse developments. For in most such\n","cases he has no real enthusiasm about the company’s prospects.\n","True, if the prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer to\n","avoid the security no matter how low the price. But the field of\n","undervalued issues is drawn from the many concerns—perhaps a\n","majority of the total—for which the future appears neither dis-\n","tinctly promising nor distinctly unpromising. If these are bought\n","on a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power\n","need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results.\n","The margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.\n","Theory of Diversification\n","There is a close logical connection between the concept of a\n","safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correla-\n","tive with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an\n","individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees\n","only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that\n","loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is\n","increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the\n","profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple\n","basis of the insurance-underwriting business.\n","Diversification is an established tenet of conservative invest-\n","ment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demon-\n","strating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which\n","diversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-\n","orful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets $1 on\n","a single number, he is paid $35 profit when he wins—but the\n","chances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He has a “negative margin of\n","safety.” In his case diversification is foolish. The more numbers he\n","bets on, the smaller his chance of ending with a profit. If he regu-\n","larly bets $1 on every number (including 0 and 00), he is certain to\n","lose $2 on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the winner received\n","$39 profit instead of $35. Then he would have a small but impor-\n","tant margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,\n","518\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","the better his chance of gain. And he could be certain of winning $2\n","on every spin by simply betting $1 each on all the numbers. (Inci-\n","dentally, the two examples given actually describe the respective\n","positions of the player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00.)*\n","A Criterion of Investment versus Speculation\n","Since there is no single definition of investment in general\n","acceptance, authorities have the right to define it pretty much as\n","they please. Many of them deny that there is any useful or depend-\n","able difference between the concepts of investment and of specula-\n","tion. We think this skepticism is unnecessary and harmful. It is\n","injurious because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of\n","many people toward the excitement and hazards of stock-market\n","speculation. We suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be\n","used to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment\n","operation from a speculative one.\n","Probably most speculators believe they have the odds in their\n","favor when they take their chances, and therefore they may lay\n","claim to a safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feel-\n","ing that the time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is\n","superior to the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustwor-\n","thy. But such claims are unconvincing. They rest on subjective\n","judgment, unsupported by any body of favorable evidence or any\n","“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment\n","519\n","* In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with numbers\n","1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a maximum payout \n","of 35 to 1. What if you bet $1 on every number? Since only one slot can \n","be the one into which the ball drops, you would win $35 on that slot, but\n","lose $1 on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of $2. That $2 differ-\n","ence (or a 5.26% spread on your total $38 bet) is the casino’s “house\n","advantage,” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will always lose more\n","than they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s interest to bet as seldom as\n","possible, it is in the casino’s interest to keep the roulette wheel spinning.\n","Likewise, the intelligent investor should seek to maximize the number of\n","holdings that offer “a better chance for profit than for loss.” For most\n","investors, diversification is the simplest and cheapest way to widen your\n","margin of safety.\n","conclusive line of reasoning. We greatly doubt whether the man\n","who stakes money on his view that the market is heading up or\n","down can ever be said to be protected by a margin of safety in any\n","useful sense of the phrase.\n","By contrast, the investor’s concept of the margin of safety—as\n","developed earlier in this chapter—rests upon simple and definite\n","arithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that it\n","is well supported by practical investment experience. There is no\n","guarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will con-\n","tinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions of\n","the future. But, equally, there is no valid reason for pessimism on\n","this score.\n","Thus, in sum, we say that to have a true investment there must\n","be present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety is\n","one that can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning,\n","and by reference to a body of actual experience.\n","Extension of the Concept of Investment\n","To complete our discussion of the margin-of-safety principle we\n","must now make a further distinction between conventional and\n","unconventional investments. Conventional investments are appro-\n","priate for the typical portfolio. Under this heading have always\n","come United States government issues and high-grade, dividend-\n","paying common stocks. We have added state and municipal bonds\n","for those who will benefit sufficiently by their tax-exempt features.\n","Also included are first-quality corporate bonds when, as now, they\n","can be bought to yield sufficiently more than United States savings\n","bonds.\n","Unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for\n","the enterprising investor. They cover a wide range. The broadest\n","category is that of undervalued common stocks of secondary com-\n","panies, which we recommend for purchase when they can be\n","bought at two-thirds or less of their indicated value. Besides these,\n","there is often a wide choice of medium-grade corporate bonds and\n","preferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices as\n","to be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparent\n","value. In these cases the average investor would be inclined to call\n","the securities speculative, because in his mind their lack of a first-\n","quality rating is synonymous with a lack of investment merit.\n","520\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","It is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a secu-\n","rity of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—\n","provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he\n","practices adequate diversification. For, if the price is low enough to\n","create a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets our\n","criterion of investment. Our favorite supporting illustration is\n","taken from the field of real-estate bonds. In the 1920s, billions of\n","dollars’ worth of these issues were sold at par and widely recom-\n","mended as sound investments. A large proportion had so little\n","margin of value over debt as to be in fact highly speculative in\n","character. In the depression of the 1930s an enormous quantity of\n","these bonds defaulted their interest, and their price collapsed—in\n","some cases below 10 cents on the dollar. At that stage the same\n","advisers who had recommended them at par as safe investments\n","were rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and unattrac-\n","tive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of about 90%\n","made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and reason-\n","ably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times\n","the market quotation.*\n","The fact that the purchase of these bonds actually resulted in\n","what is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not prevent\n","them from having true investment qualities at their low prices. The\n","“speculative” profit was the purchaser’s reward for having made\n","an unusually shrewd investment. They could properly be called\n","investment opportunities, since a careful analysis would have\n","shown that the excess of value over price provided a large margin\n","of safety. Thus the very class of “fair-weather investments” which\n","we stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naïve security\n","buyers is likely to afford many sound profit opportunities to the\n","sophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his\n","own price.†\n","“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment\n","521\n","* Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock; there\n","are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best company\n","becomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the worst com-\n","pany is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.\n","† The very people who considered technology and telecommunications\n","stocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were hellishly\n","overpriced, shunned them as “too risky” in 2002—even (cont’d on p. 522)\n","The whole field of “special situations” would come under our\n","definition of investment operations, because the purchase is\n","always predicated on a thoroughgoing analysis that promises a\n","larger realization than the price paid. Again there are risk factors in\n","each individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculations\n","and absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.\n","To carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest\n","that a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying\n","such intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-\n","stock option warrants” selling at historically low prices. (This\n","example is intended as somewhat of a shocker.)* The entire value\n","of these warrants rests on the possibility that the related stocks\n","may some day advance above the option price. At the moment\n","they have no exercisable value. Yet, since all investment rests on\n","reasonable future expectations, it is proper to view these warrants\n","in terms of the mathematical chances that some future bull market\n","will create a large increase in their indicated value and in their\n","price. Such a study might well yield the conclusion that there is\n","much more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost and\n","that the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of\n","an ultimate loss. If that is so, there is a safety margin present even\n","522\n","The Intelligent Investor\n","(cont’d from p. 521) though, in Graham’s exact words from an earlier\n","period, “the price depreciation of about 90% made many of these securities\n","exceedingly attractive and reasonably safe.” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts\n","have always tended to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, and\n","to label it a “sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Gra-\n","ham (and simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the\n","book, Graham is distinguishing speculation—or buying on the hope that a\n","stock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis of\n","what the underlying business is worth.\n","* Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for “warrant,”\n","a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder a right to pur-\n","chase the company’s stock at a predetermined price. Warrants have been\n","almost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham quips that he intends\n","the example as a “shocker” because, even in his day, warrants were\n","regarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters. (See the commentary\n","on Chapter 16.)\n","in this unprepossessing security form. A sufficiently enterprising\n","investor could then include an option-warrant operation in his\n","miscellany of unconventional investments.1\n","To Sum Up\n","Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is\n","amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in\n","Wall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles\n","through which they have gained success in their own undertak-\n","ings. Yet every corporate security may best be viewed, in the first\n","instance, as an ownership interest in, or a claim against, a specific\n","business enterprise. And if a person sets out to make profits from\n","security purchases and sales, he is embarking on a business ven-\n","ture of his own, which must be run in accordance with accepted\n","business principles if it is to have a chance of success.\n","The first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what\n","you are doing—know your business.” For the investor this means:\n","Do not try to make “business profits” out of securities—that is,\n","returns in excess of normal interest and dividend income—unless\n","you know as much about security values as you would need to\n","know about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu-\n","facture or deal in.\n","A second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your\n","business, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with ade-\n","quate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong rea-\n","sons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For\n","the investor this rule should determine the conditions under which\n","he will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.\n","A third business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—\n","that is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable cal-\n","culation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.\n","In particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to\n","gain and much to lose.” For the enterprising investor this means\n","that his operations for profit should be based not on optimism but\n","on arithmetic. For every investor it means that when he limits his\n","return to a small figure—as formerly, at least, in a conventional\n","bond or preferred stock—he must demand convincing evidence\n","that he is not risking a substantial part of his principal.\n","“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment\n","523\n","A fourth business rule is more positive: “Have the courage of\n","your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion\n","from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—\n","even though others may hesitate or differ.” (You are neither right\n","nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right\n","because your data and reasoning are right.) Similarly, in the world\n","of securities, courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate\n","knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand.\n","Fortunately for the typical investor, it is by no means necessary\n","for his success that he bring these qualities to bear upon his pro-\n","gram—provided he limits his ambition to his capacity and confines\n","his activities within the safe and narrow path of standard, defen-\n","sive investment.

The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct\n","in this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in the\n","afterlife. In this wager, Pascal asserts, “reason cannot decide” the\n","probability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and\n","only faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the proba-\n","bilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are per-\n","fectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:\n","Suppose you act as though God is and [you] lead a life of virtue and\n","abstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed up\n","some goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose\n","you act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and\n","lust when in fact God is.

Dodd.\n","This specialized volume first introduced the ideas later popularized in\n","The Intelligent Investor. Buffett’s essay offers a fascinating study of how\n","Graham’s disciples have used Graham’s value investing approach to real-\n","ize phenomenal success in the stock market.\n","Is the Graham and Dodd “look for values with a significant\n","margin of safety relative to prices” approach to security analysis\n","out of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today say\n","yes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock\n","prices reflect everything that is known about a company’s\n","prospects and about the state of the economy. There are no under-\n","valued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart secu-\n","rity analysts who utilize all available information to ensure\n","unfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the mar-\n","ket year after year are just lucky. “If prices fully reflect available\n","information, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out,” writes\n","one of today’s textbook authors.\n","Well, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors\n","who have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500\n","stock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at\n","537\n","least worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that\n","these winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as\n","superior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fif-\n","teen years ago. Absent this condition—that is, if I had just recently\n","searched among thousands of records to select a few names for you\n","this morning—I would advise you to stop reading right here. I\n","should add that all these records have been audited. And I should\n","further add that I have known many of those who have invested\n","with these managers, and the checks received by those participants\n","over the years have matched the stated records.\n","Before we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a\n","national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million\n","Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a\n","dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the\n","flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who\n","called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent\n","day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.\n","After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately\n","220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten\n","flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.\n","Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up\n","about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-\n","est, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive\n","members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what\n","marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.\n","Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards\n","from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who\n","have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who,\n","by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over \n","$1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would\n","have been won.\n","By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will proba-\n","bly write books on “How I Turned a Dollar into a Million in\n","Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet,\n","they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending semi-\n","nars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors\n","with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”\n","But then some business school professor will probably be \n","rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans \n","538\n","Appendixes\n","had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much \n","the same—215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning\n","flips.\n","I would argue, however, that there are some important differ-\n","ences in the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a)\n","you had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the\n","U.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if\n","(c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you\n","would be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would\n","probably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feeding\n","them, whether they had special exercises, what books they read,\n","and who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraor-\n","dinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you\n","could identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might\n","be causal factors.\n","Scientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were\n","trying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer—with,\n","say, 1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400\n","of them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you\n","would get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of\n","those afflicted, or other variables. You know that it’s not random\n","chance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily\n","know the causal factors, but you would know where to search.\n","I submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other\n","than geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be\n","what I call an intellectual origin. I think you will find that a dispro-\n","portionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment\n","world came from a very small intellectual village that could be\n","called Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that\n","simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu-\n","lar intellectual village.\n","Conditions could exist that would make even that concentration\n","unimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-\n","flipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he\n","called heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same\n","way. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that\n","100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing.\n","You would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Sim-\n","ilarly, let’s assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society\n","Appendixes\n","539\n","and every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten\n","members. Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so\n","strong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day,\n","every member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now,\n","at the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and\n","you would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive\n","types might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor\n","as an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it\n","would have no significance at all because it would simply mean\n","that you didn’t have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 ran-\n","domly distributed families who were winners.\n","In this group of successful investors that I want to consider,\n","there has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But\n","the children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have\n","called their “flips” in very different ways. They have gone to differ-\n","ent places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet\n","they have had a combined record that simply can’t be explained by\n","random chance. It certainly cannot be explained by the fact that\n","they are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the\n","calls to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual\n","theory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has\n","decided on his own manner of applying the theory.\n","The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-\n","and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the\n","value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in\n","the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without\n","the efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are\n","bought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July,\n","etc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just\n","what our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the\n","medium of marketable stocks—I doubt that many are cranking\n","into their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in\n","which the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any dif-\n","ference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a\n","Friday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time and\n","effort to see whether it makes a difference when buying small\n","pieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors,\n","needless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model,\n","or covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of\n","540\n","Appendixes\n","any interest to them. In fact, most of them would have difficulty\n","defining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables:\n","price and value.\n","I always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of\n","price and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine\n","buying an entire business simply because the price of the business\n","had been marked up substantially last week and the week before?\n","Of course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and\n","volume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are\n","almost endless data available about them. It isn’t necessarily\n","because such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are\n","there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathemati-\n","cal skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are\n","acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no\n","utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer,\n","everything looks like a nail.\n","I think the group that we have identified by a common intellec-\n","tual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic\n","studies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, season-\n","ality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest\n","has been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual con-\n","centration of value-oriented winners.\n","I begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of\n","us who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954\n","through 1956. There were only four—I have not selected these\n","names from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-\n","Newman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turned\n","me down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously!\n","After much pestering he finally hired me. There were three part-\n","ners and four of us at the “peasant” level. All four left between\n","1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible to\n","trace the record of three.\n","The first example (see Table 1, pages 549–550) is that of Walter\n","Schloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben\n","Graham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left\n","Graham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here\n","over 28 years.\n","Here is what “Adam Smith”—after I told him about Walter—\n","wrote about him in Supermoney (1972):\n","Appendixes\n","541\n","He has no connections or access to useful information. Practi-\n","cally no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas.\n","He looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual\n","reports, and that’s about it.\n","In introducing me to [Schloss] Warren had also, to my mind,\n","described himself. “He never forgets that he is handling other\n","people’s money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to\n","loss.” He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself.\n","Money is real to him and stocks are real—and from this flows an\n","attraction to the “margin of safety” principle.\n","Walter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks\n","currently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at consider-\n","ably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does.\n","He doesn’t worry about whether it’s January, he doesn’t worry\n","about whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an\n","election year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I\n","can buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he\n","does it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks\n","than I do—and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the\n","business: I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter.\n","That’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.\n","The second case is Tom Knapp, who also worked at Graham-\n","Newman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before\n","the war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum.\n","And then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a night\n","course in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit\n","basis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that\n","course that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School,\n","where he got the MBA degree. He took Dodd’s course again, and\n","took Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom\n","to ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the\n","beach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!\n","In 1968 Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple,\n","along with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed\n","Tweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear in\n","Table 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversifi-\n","cation. They occasionally bought control of businesses, but the\n","record of the passive investments is equal to the record of the con-\n","trol investments.\n","542\n","Appendixes\n","Table 3 describes the third member of the group who formed\n","Buffett Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in\n","1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a contin-\n","uation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single index\n","I can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment\n","management at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it\n","has been satisfactory.\n","Table 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed\n","by a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane.\n","After getting out of Harvard Business School, he went to Wall\n","Street. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business educa-\n","tion so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met\n","in early 1951. Bill’s record from 1951 to 1970, working with rela-\n","tively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound up\n","Buffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle\n","all our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a ter-\n","rible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier\n","market and all the difficulties that made for comparative perfor-\n","mance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that my\n","partners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but\n","added money, with the happy result shown.\n","There’s no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I\n","recommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if he\n","achieved a four-point-per-annum advantage over the Standard &\n","Poor’s, that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved well\n","over that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That\n","makes things much more difficult. Size is the anchor of perfor-\n","mance. There is no question about it. It doesn’t mean you can’t do\n","better than average when you get larger, but the margin shrinks.\n","And if you ever get so you’re managing two trillion dollars, and\n","that happens to be the amount of the total equity evaluation in the\n","economy, don’t think that you’ll do better than average!\n","I should add that in the records we’ve looked at so far, through-\n","out this whole period there was practically no duplication in these\n","portfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepan-\n","cies between price and value, but they make their selections very\n","differently. Walter’s largest holdings have been such stalwarts as\n","Hudson Pulp & Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New York\n","Trap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly\n","to mind to even a casual reader of the business pages. Tweedy\n","Appendixes\n","543\n","Browne’s selections have sunk even well below that level in terms\n","of name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big\n","companies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very\n","low. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty\n","people yelling out the same thing after him.\n","Table 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law\n","graduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960\n","and told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better.\n","He set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfo-\n","lio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record\n","was much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-\n","from-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and\n","valleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose\n","whole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown.\n","Incidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner \n","for a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he \n","ran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost\n","completely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned\n","earlier.\n","Table 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie\n","Munger’s—another non–business school type—who was a math\n","major at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and was\n","an IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to\n","him. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965\n","to 1983, against a compounded gain of 316 percent for the S&P,\n","came off with 22,200 percent, which, probably because he lacks a\n","business school education, he regards as statistically significant.\n","One sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buy-\n","ing dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately with people or it\n","doesn’t take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a per-\n","son right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show\n","him records, and it doesn’t make any difference. They just don’t\n","seem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. A fellow like Rick\n","Guerin, who had no formal education in business, understands\n","immediately the value approach to investing and he’s applying it\n","five minutes later. I’ve never seen anyone who became a gradual\n","convert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn’t seem to\n","be a matter of IQ or academic training. It’s instant recognition, or it\n","is nothing.\n","544\n","Appendixes\n","Table 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts\n","major at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the\n","advertising agency of Bozell & Jacobs. We happened to be in the\n","same building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better busi-\n","ness than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes\n","for Stan to embrace the value approach.\n","Perlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not\n","own what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently.\n","But every time Perlmeter buys a stock it’s because he’s getting\n","more for his money than he’s paying. That’s the only thing he’s\n","thinking about. He’s not looking at quarterly earnings projections,\n","he’s not looking at next year’s earnings, he’s not thinking about\n","what day of the week it is, he doesn’t care what investment\n","research from any place says, he’s not interested in price momen-\n","tum, volume, or anything. He’s simply asking: What is the busi-\n","ness worth?\n","Table 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been\n","involved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with\n","which I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influ-\n","enced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented man-\n","agers. Very, very few pension funds are managed from a value\n","standpoint. Table 8 is the Washington Post Company’s Pension\n","Fund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that\n","they would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.\n","As you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever\n","since they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at\n","least 25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not have\n","been necessarily the choice of these managers. So I’ve included the\n","bond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no par-\n","ticular expertise about bonds. They wouldn’t have said they did.\n","Even with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was\n","not their game, they were in the top percentile of fund manage-\n","ment. The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly\n","long period but it does represent many investment decisions by\n","three managers who were not identified retroactively.\n","Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t man-\n","age a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to\n","select value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected\n","managers much the same way as most larger companies. They now\n","Appendixes\n","545\n","rank number one in the Becker survey of pension funds for their\n","size over the period of time subsequent to this “conversion” to the\n","value approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any\n","duration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative record\n","better than the S&P. All eight had a better record last year than the\n","S&P. The net difference now between a median performance and\n","the actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243\n","million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the\n","selection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I\n","would necessarily select but they have the common denominator\n","of selecting securities based on value.\n","So these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-\n","Doddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from among\n","thousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of\n","lottery winners—people I had never heard of before they won the\n","lottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework\n","for investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught\n","and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect,\n","character, and temperament. It’s very important to understand that\n","this group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record\n","in years when the general market was weak. While they differ\n","greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the\n","business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole\n","businesses. Far more often they simply buy small pieces of busi-\n","nesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi-\n","ness, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of\n","stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the differ-\n","ence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.\n","I’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market.\n","These Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully ex-\n","ploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stock\n","can be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the\n","margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or\n","the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market\n","always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently non-\n","sensical.\n","I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward.\n","Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If\n","someone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have\n","546\n","Appendixes\n","slipped one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it\n","once? If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline—\n","perhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer\n","me $5 million to pull the trigger twice—now that would be a posi-\n","tive correlation between risk and reward!\n","The exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dol-\n","lar bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for \n","40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case.\n","The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less\n","risk there is.\n","One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was\n","selling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you\n","could have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than\n","$400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the\n","Post, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets.\n","Those same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who\n","would have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.\n","Now, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made\n","the valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would\n","have been greater. And to people who think beta measures risk, the\n","cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in\n","Wonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to\n","buy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 mil-\n","lion. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities\n","and you know anything at all about business valuation, there is\n","essentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particu-\n","larly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles for $8 million each.\n","Since you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to\n","be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people,\n","but that’s not a difficult job.\n","You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a\n","very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses.\n","But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by\n","having a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth\n","$83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous mar-\n","gin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000\n","pounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound trucks across it. And that\n","same principle works in investing.\n","In conclusion, some of the more commercially minded among\n","Appendixes\n","547\n","you may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many con-\n","verts to the value approach will perforce narrow the spreads\n","between price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been\n","out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wrote\n","Security Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing\n","in the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some per-\n","verse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.\n","The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from\n","the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s likely to\n","continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the Flat\n","Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrep-\n","ancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who\n","read their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.\n","Tables 1–9 follow:\n","548\n","Appendixes\n","TABLE 1\n","Walter J.

Important Rules Concerning Taxability of Investment\n","Income and Security Transactions (in 1972)\n","Editor’s note: Due to extensive changes in the rules governing such\n","transactions, the following document is presented here for historical\n","purposes only. When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the\n","information therein was correct. However, intervening developments\n","have rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Follow-\n","ing Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of\n","“The Basics of Investment Taxation,” which brings the reader up-to-\n","date on the relevant rules.\n","Rule 1—Interest and Dividends\n","Interest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)\n","income received from state, municipal, and similar obligations,\n","which are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b)\n","dividends representing a return of capital, (c) certain dividends\n","paid by investment companies (see below), and (d) the first $100 of\n","ordinary domestic-corporation dividends.\n","Rule 2—Capital Gains and Losses\n","Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net\n","short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses\n","are merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If the\n","net short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss,\n","100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maxi-\n","mum tax thereon is 25% up to $50,000 of such gains and 35% on the\n","balance.\n","A net capital loss (the amount exceeding capital gains) is\n","deductible from ordinary income to a maximum of $1,000 in the\n","current year and in each of the next five years. Alternatively,\n","unused losses may be applied at any time to offset capital gains.\n","(Carry-overs of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberally\n","than later losses.)\n","Note Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”\n","Most investment funds (“investment companies”) take advan-\n","tage of special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to be\n","Appendixes\n","561\n","taxed substantially as partnerships. Thus if they make long-term\n","security profits they can distribute these as “capital-gain divi-\n","dends,” which are reported by their shareholders in the same way\n","as long-term gains. These carry a lower tax rate than ordinary divi-\n","dends. Alternatively, such a company may elect to pay the 25% tax\n","for the account of its shareholders and then retain the balance of\n","the capital gains without distributing them as capital-gain divi-\n","dends.\n","3. The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)\n","Interest and Dividends\n","Interest and dividends are taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate\n","except (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from\n","Federal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends rep-\n","resenting a return of capital, and (c) long-term capital-gain distribu-\n","tions paid by mutual funds (see below). Private-activity municipal\n","bonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the Federal alter-\n","native minimum tax.\n","Capital Gains and Losses\n","Short-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short-\n","term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses are\n","merged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net\n","short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, that\n","excess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term capi-\n","tal gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally 20%—\n","which will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,\n","2000, and held for more than five years.\n","A net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim-\n","um of $3,000 in the current year. Any capital losses in excess of\n","$3,000 may be applied in later tax years to offset future capital \n","gains.\n","Mutual Funds\n","As “regulated investment companies,” nearly all mutual funds take\n","advantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from\n","562\n","Appendixes\n","corporate income tax. After selling long-term holdings, mutual funds\n","can distribute the profits as “capital-gain dividends,” which their share-\n","holders treat as long-term gains. These are taxed at a lower rate (gen-\n","erally 20%) than ordinary dividends (up to 39%). You should generally\n","avoid making large new investments during the fourth quarter of each\n","year, when these capital-gain distributions are usually distributed; oth-\n","erwise you will incur tax for a gain earned by the fund before you even\n","owned it.\n","4. The New Speculation in Common Stocks1\n","What I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years\n","in Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has\n","included the recurrent advent of new conditions, or a new atmo-\n","sphere, which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true that\n","one of the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and secu-\n","rity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid-\n","ity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we\n","have no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least\n","studied and understood them. My address today is an effort\n","toward such understanding in a limited field—in particular, an\n","endeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the\n","present and the past in our underlying attitudes toward invest-\n","ment and speculation in common stocks.\n","Let me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the specu-\n","lative elements of a common stock resided almost exclusively in\n","the company itself; they were due to uncertainties, or fluctuating\n","elements, or downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corpora-\n","tion’s individual setup. These elements of speculation still exist, of\n","course; but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished\n","by a number of long-term developments to which I shall refer. But\n","in revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro-\n","duced into the common-stock arena from outside the companies. It\n","comes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying public\n","and their advisers—chiefly us security analysts. This attitude may\n","be described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future expecta-\n","tions.\n","Nothing will appear more logical and natural to this audience\n","than the idea that a common stock should be valued and priced\n","Appendixes\n","563\n","primarily on the basis of the company’s expected future perfor-\n","mance. Yet this simple-appearing concept carries with it a number\n","of paradoxes and pitfalls. For one thing, it obliterates a good part of\n","the older, well-established distinctions between investment and\n","speculation. The dictionary says that “speculate” comes from the\n","Latin “specula,” a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who looked\n","out and saw future developments coming before other people did.\n","But today, if the investor is shrewd or well advised, he too must\n","have his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common\n","lookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.\n","Secondly, we find that, for the most part, companies with the\n","best investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are the\n","ones which are likely to attract the largest speculative interest in\n","their common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteed\n","a brilliant future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-\n","ticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the application\n","of formulas out of higher mathematics to establish the present\n","value of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu-\n","las with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, or\n","rather to justify, practically any value one wishes, however high,\n","for a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on\n","close examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-\n","sonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and\n","maintain itself for a given growth company; hence at times the\n","market may conceivably value the growth component at a strik-\n","ingly low figure.\n","Returning to my distinction between the older and newer spec-\n","ulative elements in common stock, we might characterize them by\n","two outlandish but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exoge-\n","nous. Let me illustrate briefly the old-time speculative common\n","stock, as distinguished from an investment stock, by some data\n","relating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1911–1913.\n","(These appear in Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, Security\n","Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)\n","In those three years the price range of “Pennsy” moved only\n","between 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn-\n","ings for the period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable\n","$3 dividend, and investors were sure that it was backed by well\n","over its par of $50 in tangible assets. By contrast, the price of Amer-\n","564\n","Appendixes\n","ican Can ranged between 9 and 47; its earnings between 7 cents\n","and $8.86; the ratio of price to the three-year average earnings\n","moved between 1.9 times and 10 times; it paid no dividend at all;\n","and sophisticated investors were well aware that the $100 par\n","value of the common represented nothing but undisclosed\n","“water,” since the preferred issue exceeded the tangible assets\n","available for it. Thus American Can common was a representative\n","speculative issue, because American Can Company was then a\n","speculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain\n","industry. Actually, American Can had a far more brilliant long-\n","term future than Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact\n","not suspected by investors or speculators in those days, but even if\n","it had been it would probably have been put aside by the investors\n","as basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in the\n","years 1911–1913.\n","Now, to expose you to the development through time of the\n","importance of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to\n","use as my example our most spectacular giant industrial enter-\n","prise—none other than International Business Machines, which\n","last year entered the small group of companies with $1 billion of\n","sales. May I introduce one or two autobiographical notes here, in\n","order to inject a little of the personal touch into what otherwise\n","would be an excursion into cold figures? In 1912 I had left college\n","for a term to take charge of a research project for U.S. Express Com-\n","pany. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-\n","lutionary new system of computing express rates. For this purpose\n","we used the so-called Hollerith machines, leased out by the then\n","Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card\n","punches, card sorters, and tabulators—tools almost unknown to\n","businessmen, then, and having their chief application in the Cen-\n","sus Bureau. I entered Wall Street in 1914, and the next year the\n","bonds and common stock of C.-T.-R. Company were listed on the\n","New York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind of sentimental inter-\n","est in that enterprise, and besides I considered myself a sort of\n","technological expert on their products, being one of the few finan-\n","cial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I went to\n","the head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to him\n","that C.-T.-R. stock was selling in the middle 40s (for 105,000\n","shares); that it had earned $6.50 in 1915; that its book value—\n","Appendixes\n","565\n","including, to be sure, some nonsegregated intangibles—was $130;\n","that it had started a $3 dividend; and that I thought rather highly of\n","the company’s products and prospects. Mr. A. N. looked at me\n","pityingly. “Ben,” said he, “do not mention that company to me\n","again. I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. [His favorite\n","expression.] Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and they\n","are no good. So how can the stock be any good? Everybody knows\n","there is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In those days that\n","was the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the asset account\n","of the balance sheet was fictitious. Many industrial companies—\n","notably U.S. Steel—despite their $100 par, represented nothing but\n","water, concealed in a written-up plant account. Since they had\n","“nothing” to back them but earning power and future prospects,\n","no self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)\n","I returned to my statistician’s cubbyhole, a chastened young\n","man. Mr. A. N. was not only experienced and successful, but\n","extremely shrewd as well. So much was I impressed by his sweep-\n","ing condemnation of Computing-Tabulating-Recording that I\n","never bought a share of it in my life, not even after its name was\n","changed to International Business Machines in 1926.\n","Now let us take a look at the same company with its new name\n","in 1926, a year of pretty high stock markets. At that time it first\n","revealed the good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large\n","sum of $13.6 million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar\n","of the so-called equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth-\n","ing but water. However, since that time the company had made an\n","impressive record under the direction of T. L. Watson, Sr. Its net\n","had risen from $691,000 to $3.7 million—over fivefold—a greater\n","percentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent eleven-year\n","period. It had built up a nice tangible equity for the common, and\n","had split it 3.6 for one. It had established a $3 dividend rate for the\n","new stock, while earnings were $6.39 thereon. You might have\n","expected the 1926 stock market to have been pretty enthusiastic\n","about a company with such a growth history and so strong a trade\n","position. Let us see. The price range for that year was 31 low, 59\n","high. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multi-\n","plier of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it had\n","done in 1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible\n","book value, and in that respect was far more conservatively priced\n","than eleven years earlier.\n","566\n","Appendixes\n","These data illustrate, as well as any can, the persistence of the\n","old-time investment viewpoint until the culminating years of the\n","bull market of the 1920s. What has happened since then can be\n","summarized by using ten-year intervals in the history of IBM. In\n","1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures, and the average multi-\n","plier rose from 7 to 171⁄2. From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 21⁄2 times,\n","but the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 171⁄2. Then the pace\n","accelerated. The 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946, and the\n","average multiplier rose to 321⁄2. Last year, with a further gain in net,\n","the multiplier rose again to an average of 42, if we do not count the\n","unconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary.\n","When we examine these recent price figures with care we see\n","some interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years\n","earlier. The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balance\n","sheets of industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first by\n","disclosure and then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water has\n","been put back into the valuation by the stock market—by investors\n","and speculators themselves. When IBM now sells at 7 times its\n","book value, instead of 7 times earnings, the effect is practically the\n","same as if it had no book value at all. Or the small book-value por-\n","tion can be considered as a sort of minor preferred-stock compo-\n","nent of the price, the rest representing exactly the same sort of\n","commitment as the old-time speculator made when he bought\n","Woolworth or U.S. Steel common entirely for their earning power\n","and future prospects.\n","It is worth remarking, in passing, that in the thirty years which\n","saw IBM transformed from a 7-times earnings to a 40-times earn-\n","ings enterprise, many of what I have called the endogenous specu-\n","lative aspects of our large industrial companies have tended to\n","disappear, or at least to diminish greatly. Their financial positions\n","are firm, their capital structures conservative: they are managed far\n","more expertly, and even more honestly, than before. Furthermore,\n","the requirements of complete disclosure have removed one of the\n","important speculative elements of years ago—that derived from\n","ignorance and mystery.\n","Another personal digression here. In my early years in the Street\n","one of the favorite mystery stocks was Consolidated Gas of New\n","York, now Consolidated Edison. It owned as a subsidiary the prof-\n","itable New York Edison Company, but it reported only dividends\n","received from this source, not its full earnings. The unreported Edi-\n","Appendixes\n","567\n","son earnings supplied the mystery and the “hidden value.” To my\n","surprise I discovered that these hush-hush figures were actually on\n","file each year with the Public Service Commission of the state. It\n","was a simple matter to consult the records and to present the true\n","earnings of Consolidated Gas in a magazine article. (Incidentally,\n","the addition to profits was not spectacular.) One of my older\n","friends said to me then: “Ben, you may think you are a great guy to\n","supply those missing figures, but Wall Street is going to thank you\n","for nothing. Consolidated Gas with the mystery is both more inter-\n","esting and more valuable than ex-mystery. You youngsters who\n","want to stick your noses into everything are going to ruin Wall\n","Street.”\n","It is true that the three M’s which then supplied so much fuel to\n","the speculative fires have now all but disappeared. These were\n","Mystery, Manipulation, and (thin) Margins. But we security ana-\n","lysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are\n","so speculative in themselves as to pretty well take the place of\n","those older speculative factors. Do we not have our own “3M’s”\n","now—none other than Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing\n","Company—and does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the\n","new speculation as contrasted with the old? Consider a few fig-\n","ures. When M. M. & M. common sold at 101 last year the market\n","was valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which happened to show\n","no increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself was valued at\n","$1.7 billion, of which $200 million was covered by net assets, and a\n","cool $11⁄2 billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”\n","We do not know the process of calculation by which that valuation\n","of good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later\n","the market revised this appraisal downward by some $450 million,\n","or about 30 per cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accu-\n","rately the intangible component of a splendid company such as\n","this. It follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor-\n","tant the good will or future earning-power factor the more uncer-\n","tain becomes the true value of the enterprise, and therefore the\n","more speculative inherently the common stock.\n","It may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed\n","in the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare ear-\n","lier times with today. A generation or more ago it was the standard\n","rule, recognized both in average stock prices and in formal or legal\n","568\n","Appendixes\n","valuations, that intangibles were to be appraised on a more conser-\n","vative basis than tangibles. A good industrial company might be\n","required to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible\n","assets, represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but its\n","excess earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would be\n","valued on, say, a 15 per cent basis. (You will find approximately\n","these ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-\n","mon stock in 1911, and in numerous others.) But what has hap-\n","pened since the 1920s? Essentially the exact reverse of these\n","relationships may now be seen. A company must now typically\n","earn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the\n","average market at full book value. But its excess earnings, above 10\n","per cent on capital, are usually valued more liberally, or at a higher\n","multiplier, than the base earnings required to support the book\n","value in the market. Thus a company earning 15 per cent on the\n","equity may well sell at 131⁄2 times earnings, or twice its net assets.\n","This would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val-\n","ued at only 10 times, but the next 5 per cent—what used to be\n","called the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.\n","Now there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce-\n","dure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-\n","tions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given these\n","liberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself,\n","and the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more\n","cogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand in\n","hand with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is really\n","paid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not\n","the good will in the old and restricted sense of an established name\n","and a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec-\n","tations of increased profits in the future.\n","This brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of\n","the new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shall\n","touch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests\n","show, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—\n","i.e., as the rate of return on book value increases—then the arith-\n","metical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increase\n","directly as the square of the earnings, but inversely the book value.\n","Thus in an important and very real sense tangible assets have\n","become a drag on average market value rather than a source\n","Appendixes\n","569\n","thereof. Take a far from extreme illustration. If Company A earns $4\n","a share on a $20 book value, and Company B also $4 a share on\n","$100 book value, Company A is almost certain to sell at a higher\n","multiplier, and hence at higher price than Company B—say $60 for\n","Company A shares and $35 for Company B shares. Thus it would\n","not be inexact to declare that the $80 per share of greater assets for\n","Company B are responsible for the $25 per share lower market\n","price, since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal.\n","But more important than the foregoing is the general relation-\n","ship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values.\n","Given the three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the\n","rate of earnings growth, (b) a sufficiently long projection of this\n","growth into the future, and (c) the miraculous workings of com-\n","pound interest—lo! the security analyst is supplied with a new\n","kind of philosopher’s stone which can produce or justify any\n","desired valuation for a really “good stock.” I have commented in a\n","recent article in the Analysts’ Journal on the vogue of higher mathe-\n","matics in bull markets, and quoted David Durand’s exposition of\n","the striking analogy between value calculations of growth stocks\n","and the famous Petersburg Paradox, which has challenged and\n","confused mathematicians for more than two hundred years. The\n","point I want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the\n","relationship between mathematics and investment attitudes on\n","common stocks, which is this: Mathematics is ordinarily consid-\n","ered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stock\n","market the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more\n","uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.\n","In forty-four years of Wall Street experience and study I have never\n","seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\n","related investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or\n","the most elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, \n","or higher algebra, you could take it as a warning signal that the\n","operator was trying to substitute theory for experience, and usu-\n","ally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment.\n","The older ideas of common-stock investment may seem quite\n","naïve to the sophisticated security analyst of today. The great\n","emphasis was always on what we now call the defensive aspects of\n","the company or issue—mainly the assurance that it would con-\n","tinue its dividend unreduced in bad times. Thus the strong rail-\n","570\n","Appendixes\n","roads, which constituted the standard investment commons of fifty\n","years ago, were actually regarded in very much the same way as\n","the public-utility commons in recent years. If the past record indi-\n","cated stability, the chief requirement was met; not too much effort\n","was made to anticipate adverse changes of an underlying character\n","in the future. But, conversely, especially favorable future prospects\n","were regarded by shrewd investors as something to look for but\n","not to pay for.\n","In effect this meant that the investor did not have to pay any-\n","thing substantial for superior long-term prospects. He got these,\n","virtually without extra cost, as a reward for his own superior intel-\n","ligence and judgment in picking the best rather than the merely\n","good companies. For common stocks with the same financial\n","strength, past earnings record, and dividend stability all sold at\n","about the same dividend yield.\n","This was indeed a shortsighted point of view, but it had the\n","great advantage of making common-stock investment in the old\n","days not only simple but also basically sound and highly prof-\n","itable. Let me return for the last time to a personal note. Some-\n","where around 1920 our firm distributed a series of little pamphlets\n","entitled Lessons for Investors. Of course it took a brash analyst in his\n","middle twenties like myself to hit on so smug and presumptuous a\n","title. But in one of the papers I made the casual statement that “if a\n","common stock is a good investment it is also a good speculation.”\n","For, reasoned I, if a common stock was so sound that it carried very\n","little risk of loss it must ordinarily be so good as to possess excel-\n","lent chances for future gains. Now this was a perfectly true and\n","even valuable discovery, but it was true only because nobody paid\n","any attention to it. Some years later, when the public woke up to\n","the historical merits of common stocks as long-term investments,\n","they soon ceased to have any such merit, because the public’s\n","enthusiasm created price levels which deprived them of their built-\n","in margin of safety, and thus drove them out of the investment\n","class. Then, of course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme,\n","and we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring\n","(in 1931) that no common stock could ever be an investment.\n","When we view this long-range experience in perspective we\n","find another set of paradoxes in the investor’s changing attitude\n","toward capital gains as contrasted with income. It seems a truism\n","Appendixes\n","571\n","to say that the old-time common-stock investor was not much\n","interested in capital gains. He bought almost entirely for safety and\n","income, and let the speculator concern himself with price apprecia-\n","tion. Today we are likely to say that the more experienced and\n","shrewd the investor, the less attention he pays to dividend returns,\n","and the more heavily his interest centers on long-term apprecia-\n","tion. Yet one might argue, perversely, that precisely because the\n","old-time investor did not concentrate on future capital apprecia-\n","tion he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he would have it,\n","at least in the field of industrial stocks. And, conversely, today’s\n","investor is so concerned with anticipating the future that he is\n","already paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has\n","projected with so much study and care may actually happen and\n","still not bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to the\n","degree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary\n","and perhaps even permanent loss.\n","What lessons—again using the pretentious title of my 1920 pam-\n","phlet—can the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past with\n","current attitudes? Not much of value, one is inclined to say. We can\n","look back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for\n","the present and could get the future for nothing—an “all this and\n","Heaven too” combination. Shaking our heads sadly we mutter,\n","“Those days are gone forever.” Have not investors and security\n","analysts eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects?\n","By so doing have they not permanently expelled themselves from\n","that Eden where promising common stocks at reasonable prices\n","could be plucked off the bushes? Are we doomed always to run the\n","risk either of paying unreasonably high prices for good quality and\n","prospects, or of getting poor quality and prospects when we pay\n","what seems a reasonable price?\n","It certainly looks that way. Yet one cannot be sure even of that\n","pessimistic dilemma. Recently, I did a little research in the long-\n","term history of that towering enterprise, General Electric—stimu-\n","lated by the arresting chart of fifty-nine years of earnings and\n","dividends appearing in their recently published 1957 Report. These\n","figures are not without their surprises for the knowledgeable ana-\n","lyst. For one thing they show that prior to 1947 the growth of G. E.\n","was fairly modest and quite irregular. The 1946 earnings, per share\n","adjusted, were only 30 per cent higher than in 1902—52 cents ver-\n","572\n","Appendixes\n","sus 40 cents—and in no year of this period were the 1902 earnings\n","as much as doubled. Yet the price-earnings ratio rose from 9 times\n","in 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again in 1946. One might\n","say, of course, that the 1946 multiplier at least showed the well-\n","known prescience of shrewd investors. We analysts were able to\n","foresee then the really brilliant period of growth that was looming\n","ahead in the next decade. Maybe so. But some of you remember\n","that the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high\n","for G.E.’s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary\n","fall in the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1\n","split) G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings\n","and its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings.\n","Our crystal ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelve\n","months.\n","This striking reversal took place only eleven years ago. It casts\n","some little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability of\n","the popular belief among analysts that prominent and promising\n","companies will now always sell at high price-earnings ratios—that\n","this is a fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as well\n","accept and like it. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic on this\n","point. All I can say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of\n","you must seek to settle it for yourself.\n","But in my concluding remarks I can say something definite\n","about the structure of the market for various types of common\n","stocks, in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics.\n","In the old days the investment character of a common stock was\n","more or less the same as, or proportionate with, that of the enter-\n","prise itself, as measured quite well by its credit rating. The lower\n","the yield on its bonds or preferred, the more likely was the com-\n","mon to meet all the criteria for a satisfactory investment, and the\n","smaller the element of speculation involved in its purchase. This\n","relationship, between the speculative ranking of the common and\n","the investment rating of the company, could be graphically\n","expressed pretty much as a straight line descending from left to\n","right. But nowadays I would describe the graph as U-shaped. At\n","the left, where the company itself is speculative and its credit low,\n","the common stock is of course highly speculative, just as it has\n","always been in the past. At the right extremity, however, where the\n","company has the highest credit rating because both its past record\n","Appendixes\n","573\n","and future prospects are most impressive, we find that the stock\n","market tends more or less continuously to introduce a highly spec-\n","ulative element into the common shares through the simple means\n","of a price so high as to carry a fair degree of risk.\n","At this point I cannot forbear introducing a surprisingly rele-\n","vant, if quite exaggerated, quotation on the subject which I found\n","recently in one of Shakespeare’s sonnets. It reads:\n","Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor\n","Lose all and more by paying too much rent?\n","Returning to my imaginary graph, it would be the center area\n","where the speculative element in common-stock purchases would\n","tend to reach its minimum. In this area we could find many well-\n","established and strong companies, with a record of past growth\n","corresponding to that of the national economy and with future\n","prospects apparently of the same character. Such common stocks\n","could be bought at most times, except in the upper ranges of a bull\n","market, at moderate prices in relation to their indicated intrinsic\n","values. As a matter of fact, because of the present tendency of\n","investors and speculators alike to concentrate on more glamorous\n","issues, I should hazard the statement that these middle-ground\n","stocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their independently\n","determinable values. They thus have a margin-of-safety factor sup-\n","plied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend to\n","destroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues. Further-\n","more, in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for\n","penetrating analysis of the past record and for discriminating\n","choice in the area of future prospects, to which can be added the\n","higher assurance of safety conferred by diversification.\n","When Phaëthon insisted on driving the chariot of the Sun, his\n","father, the experienced operator, gave the neophyte some advice\n","which the latter failed to follow—to his cost. Ovid summed up\n","Phoebus Apollo’s counsel in three words:\n","Medius tutissimus ibis\n","You will go safest in the middle course\n","I think this principle holds good for investors and their security\n","analyst advisers.\n","574\n","Appendixes\n","5.

Tax Accounting for NVF’s Acquisition of Sharon \n","Steel Shares\n","1. NVF acquired 88% of Sharon stock in 1969, paying for each\n","share $70 in NVF 5% bonds, due 1994, and warrants to buy 11⁄2\n","576\n","Appendixes\n","shares of NVF at $22 per share. The initial market value of the\n","bonds appears to have been only 43% of par, while the warrants\n","were quoted at $10 per NVF share involved. This meant that the\n","Sharon holders got only $30 worth of bonds but $15 worth of war-\n","rants for each share turned in, a total of $45 per share. (This was\n","about the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing price\n","for the year.) The book value of Sharon was $60 per share. The dif-\n","ference between this book value and the market value of Sharon\n","stock amounted to about $21 million on the 1,415,000 shares of\n","Sharon acquired.\n","2. The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three\n","things: (a) To treat the issuance of the bonds as equivalent to a\n","“sale” thereof at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from\n","income for amortization of the huge bond discount of $54 million.\n","(Actually it would be charging itself about 15% annual interest on\n","the “proceeds” of the $99 million debenture issue.) (b) To offset this\n","bond-discount charge by an approximately equal “profit,” consist-\n","ing of a credit to income of one-tenth of the difference between the\n","cost price of 45 for the Sharon stock and its book value of 60. (This\n","would correspond, in reverse fashion, to the required practice of\n","charging income each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi-\n","tions in excess of the book value of the assets acquired.) (c) The\n","beauty of this arrangement would be that the company could save\n","initially about $900,000 a year, or $1 per share, in income taxes from\n","these two annual entries, because the amortization of bond dis-\n","count could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization\n","of “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in tax-\n","able income.\n","3. This accounting treatment is reflected in both the consoli-\n","dated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF\n","for 1969, and pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of\n","Sharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants, it was nec-\n","essary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part of\n","the common-stock capital figure. Thus in this case, as in no other\n","that we know, the warrants were assigned a substantial value in\n","the balance sheet, namely $22 million+ (but only in an explanatory\n","note).\n","Appendixes\n","577\n","7. Technological Companies as Investments\n","In the Standard & Poor’s services in mid-1971 there were listed\n","about 200 companies with names beginning with Compu-, Data,\n","Electro-, Scien-, Techno-.

On p. 295 we set forth a formula relating multipliers to the rate of\n","expected growth.\n","6. Part of the fireworks in the price of Chrysler was undoubtedly\n","inspired by two two-for-one stock splits taking place in the single\n","year 1963—an unprecedented phenomenon for a major company. In\n","the early 1980s, under Lee Iacocca, Chrysler did a three-peat, coming\n","back from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the best-performing\n","stocks in America. However, identifying managers who can lead great\n","corporate comebacks is not as easy as it seems. When Al Dunlap took\n","over Sunbeam Corp. in 1996 after restructuring Scott Paper Co. (and\n","driving its stock price up 225% in 18 months), Wall Street hailed him as\n","little short of the Second Coming. Dunlap turned out to be a sham who\n","used improper accounting and false financial statements to mislead\n","Sunbeam’s investors—including the revered money managers Michael\n","Price and Michael Steinhardt, who had hired him. For a keen dissection\n","of Dunlap’s career, see John A. Byrne, Chainsaw (HarperCollins, New\n","York, 1999).\n","584\n","Endnotes\n","7. Note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the “true value”\n","of a growth stock, but only that it approximates the results of the\n","more elaborate calculations in vogue.\n","Chapter 12. Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings\n","1. Our recommended method of dealing with the warrant dilution is\n","discussed below. We prefer to consider the market value of the war-\n","rants as an addition to the current market price of the common stock\n","as a whole.\n","Chapter 13. A Comparison of Four Listed Companies\n","1. In March 1972, Emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings!\n","Chapter 14. Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor\n","1. Because of numerous stock splits, etc., through the years, the actual\n","average price of the DJIA list was about $53 per share in early 1972.\n","2. In 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show current\n","assets equal to twice current liabilities, and only two failed to have\n","net current assets exceeding their debt. By December 1970 the num-\n","ber in each category had grown from two to twelve.\n","3. But note that their combined market action from December 1970 to\n","early 1972 was poorer than that of the DJIA. This demonstrates once\n","again that no system or formula will guarantee superior market\n","results. Our requirements “guarantee” only that the portfolio-buyer is\n","getting his money’s worth.\n","4. As a consequence we must exclude the majority of gas pipeline\n","stocks, since these enterprises are heavily bonded. The justification\n","for this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which\n","“guarantee” bond payments; but the considerations here may be too\n","complicated for the needs of a defensive investor.\n","Chapter 15. Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n","1. Mutual Funds and Other Institutional Investors: A New Perspective,\n","I. Friend, M. Blume, and J. Crockett, McGraw-Hill, 1970. We should\n","add that the 1966–1970 results of many of the funds we studied were\n","Endnotes\n","585\n","somewhat better than those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock com-\n","posite and considerably better than those of the DJIA.\n","2. Personal note: Many years before the stock-market pyrotechnics in\n","that particular company the author was its “financial vice-president”\n","at the princely salary of $3,000 per annum. It was then really in the\n","fireworks business. In early 1929, Graham became a financial vice pres-\n","ident of Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., the nation’s largest producer of\n","fireworks. Unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company and\n","no longer exists in independent form.\n","3. The Guide does not show multipliers above 99. Most such would be\n","mathematical oddities, caused by earnings just above the zero point.\n","Chapter 16. Convertible Issues and Warrants\n","1. This point is well illustrated by an offering of two issues of Ford\n","Motor Finance Co. made simultaneously in November 1971. One was\n","a 20-year nonconvertible bond, yielding 71⁄2%. The other was a 25-year\n","bond, subordinated to the first in order of claim and yielding only\n","41⁄2%; but it was made convertible into Ford Motor stock, against its\n","then price of 681⁄2. To obtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave\n","up 40% of income and accepted a junior-creditor position.\n","2. Note that in late 1971 Studebaker-Worthington common sold as low\n","as 38 while the $5 preferred sold at or about 77. The spread had thus\n","grown from 2 to 20 points during the year, illustrating once more the\n","desirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock mar-\n","ket to neglect arithmetic. (Incidentally the small premium of the pre-\n","ferred over the common in December 1970 had already been made up\n","by its higher dividend.)\n","Chapter 17. Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\n","1. See, for example, the article “Six Flags at Half Mast,” by Dr. A. J.\n","Briloff, in Barron’s, January 11, 1971.\n","Chapter 18. A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies\n","1. The reader will recall from p. 434 above that AAA Enterprises tried to\n","enter this business, but quickly failed. Here Graham is making a pro-\n","586\n","Endnotes\n","found and paradoxical observation: The more money a company makes,\n","the more likely it is to face new competition, since its high returns signal\n","so clearly that easy money is to be had. The new competition, in turn, will\n","lead to lower prices and smaller profits. This crucial point was over-\n","looked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed that early\n","winners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.\n","Chapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy\n","1. Analytical studies have shown that in the typical case a dollar paid\n","out in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar-\n","ket price as had a dollar of undistributed earnings. This point was\n","well illustrated by the public-utility group for a number of years\n","before 1950. The low-payout issues sold at low multipliers of earn-\n","ings, and proved to be especially attractive buys because their divi-\n","dends were later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much\n","more uniform for the industry.\n","Chapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept \n","of Investment\n","1. This argument is supported by Paul Hallingby, Jr., “Speculative\n","Opportunities in Stock-Purchase Warrants,” Analysts’ Journal, third\n","quarter 1947.\n","Postscript\n","1. Veracity requires the admission that the deal almost fell through\n","because the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would\n","be 100% covered by asset value. A future $300 million or more in mar-\n","ket gain turned on, say, $50,000 of accounting items. By dumb luck\n","they got what they insisted on.\n","Appendixes\n","1.

In this chapter we’ll\n","look at several techniques that some of today’s leading money man-\n","agers use for picking stocks.\n","First, though, it’s worth repeating that for most investors, selecting\n","individual stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. The fact that most\n","professionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean that most\n","amateurs can do better. The vast majority of people who try to pick\n","stocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought; the lucki-\n","est ones discover this early on, while the less fortunate take years to\n","learn it. A small percentage of investors can excel at picking their own\n","stocks. Everyone else would be better off getting help, ideally through\n","an index fund.\n","Graham advised investors to practice first, just as even the greatest\n","athletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual per-\n","formance.

Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-\n","vent you from forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to be\n","stinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners and your losers.\n","After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if\n","you had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund.
